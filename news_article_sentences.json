of 20 advisers and special assistants to the prime minister","2":"Two notifications issued by the Cabinet Division said Prime Minister Imran Khan had accepted both Aidrus and Mirza's resignations","3":"Aidrus said she was resigning from her post due to recent criticism levelled against her and the government because of her dual citizenship","4":"In a tweet, Aidrus said: \"Criticism levied towards the state as a consequence of my citizenship status is clouding the purpose of Digital Pakistan\"","5":"\"In the greater public interest, I have submitted my resignation from the SAPM role","6":"I will continue to serve my country and the PM\u2019s vision to my best ability","7":"\" She also attached a picture of her resignation letter addressed to the premier","8":"In the letter, she stated that she had returned to Pakistan with the \"singular intent to contribute and develop the vision of a Digital Pakistan\"","9":"\"I always was and shall be a Pakistani","10":"\"She added that her Canadian nationality, a consequence of her birth and not an acquisition of choice, served as a distraction to her ability to execute the long-term vision for a Digital Pakistan","11":"\"It is unfortunate that a Pakistani's desire to serve Pakistan is clouded by such issues","12":"\"Shortly after Aidrus announced her resignation, Mirza took to Twitter to do the same","13":"He said that he had come to Pakistan on the personal invitation of the premier after leaving the World Health Organisation (WHO)","14":"\"I worked hard and honestly","15":"It was a privilege to serve Pakistan","16":"I am satisfied that I leave at a time when Covid -19 has declined in Pakistan as a result of a grand national effort","17":"\" He added that he had made the decision

cause","20":"Pakistan will Inshallah emerge out of Covid-19 with a stronger healthcare system","21":"\"Prime Minister Khan had launched the Digital Pakistan programme in December last year and named Aidrus, a Google executive who quit her position, to lead the initiative","22":"Later in February, she was appointed as SAPM on Digital Pakistan","23":"Meanwhile, Mirza was assigned the portfolio of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination in April 2019 and was engaged in overseeing the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic","24":"Prior to this, he was working as director of Health System Development at the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean","25":"Last month, the National Accountability Bureau had said it was initiating an inquiry against Dr Mirza","26":"Mirza, who had earlier received the wrath of the Supreme Court over the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the country, was accused of involvement in the smuggling of 20 million face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of coronavirus' spread and import of vitamins, drugs and salts from India in the garb of life-saving drugs","27":"On July 18,  the cabinet division had issued the details of the assets and nationalities of 20 advisers and special assistants to the prime minister","28":"The cabinet division\u2019s notification placed on its website showed that out of 19 non-elected cabinet members, four special assistants to the prime minister hold dual nationalities, including SAPM on Petroleum Nadeem Babar (US), SAPM on Overseas

Islamabad, amounting to Rs20m and two plots in DHA Rawalpindi and Taxila worth Rs15m each","30":"After the details were made public, the opposition was quick to lash out at the government for its hypocrisy and had questioned how the premier's advisers and aides sitting in the federal cabinet can be dual nationals when the same was not permissible for members of parliament","31":"\"Imran Khan has repeatedly said he stands against government aides, advisers, ministers who swear an oath of allegiance to another country","32":"What happened to #MadeinPakistan","33":",\" PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had said","34":"In 1909, a group of Italian painters shocked the art world with a manifesto that denounced classical art and art museums","35":"These \u2018futurists\u2019 spoke of exalting the war and the \u2018reckless artist\u2019 who celebrated modern-day objects that demonstrated aggression, mechanical velocity and technology","36":"\u201cA race car, its hood adorned with big pipes, like snakes with explosive breath, a roaring automobile, which seems to race along machine gun fire, is more beautiful than the \u2018Winged Victory of Smothrace\u2019,\u201d wrote founder of Futurism and art theorist F","37":"T","38":"Marinetti in his Manifesto of Futurism (1909)","39":"Futurism is a modern art movement where the painted or sculpted object often represents \u201cdynamism in art\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon that involves changing states of matter and motion","40":"These characteristics of futurist art, among many other modern art styles and movements, are thus dependent on the observance of time","41":"Italian painter Umberto Boccioni represented time and movement through many works, his most famous being the \u2018Unique Forms Of Continuity In Space\u2019 (1913)","42":"As the bronze sculpture is based on a human figure whose armless upper torso and legs organically mould into each other, the reality of transcending time channels through this sculpted representation of motion and fluidity of matter","43":"Similarly, \u2018The Cyclist\u2019 (1913) by Russian painter Natalia Goncharova shows a man on a bicycle as Russian words for \u2018hat\u2019, \u2018silk\u2019 and \u2018thread\u2019 are seen on the billboards behind him","44":"The painting breaks down the speed of the vehicle via its two-dimensional format, as the side-view of the bicycle and the man is visually multiplied to portray the relationship between movement and time, second by second, within the painting\u2019s composition","45":"The fascination with time may have been expressed by modern artists but the concept is certainly not new in Western history of art","46":"Symbolically, time is often represented through the concept of vanitas and memento mori in Dutch genre painting of the 16th and 17th centuries","47":"Philosophically, vanitas represented the passing of time and the worthlessness of mundane pleasure, while memento mori brings our attention to the certainty of death","48":"In \u2018The Last Drop\u2019 (1639) by Dutch painter Judith Leyster, two inebriated men are shown: the seated young man on the left of the painting drinks from a round flask while his companion stands beside him on the right","49":"A skeleton behind the two men tries to grasp their attention with a skull in its hand","50":"Leyster overlaps vanitas (the cheerful and drunk youth) with memento mori (the skeleton and the skull) to ultimately hint at the unstoppable passage of time that will eventually lead the two men to their deaths","51":"Gradually, the concept of time expanded beyond skulls and hourglasses in painting, as the art movement of \u2018Impressionism\u2019 (late 1800s) focused on how time visually affected the outdoors","52":"\u2018Haystacks\u2019 (1890-91), a series of paintings by French painter Claude Monet illustrates a harvested stack of wheat in the open, where the changing light from different times of the day illuminates the landscape with varying colours and aerial atmospheres","53":"Monet also painted landscapes during sunrise and sunsets, as they appeared to his eyes, to illustrate the scenic outdoors as naturally as possible with observable differences during the varying hours of the day","54":"Time as a concept and reality has captivated many artists throughout the history of artWhile eras, concepts, and media differ in the execution of art, one unifying and observable element is an attempt by  artists to comprehend how time ages human beings and limits ambition due to the indestructible quality of death","55":"Artists have reflected by merging this reality with the human psyche and functions such as sleep and memory","56":"Surrealism underpinned the field of psychology in the 20th century to understand time through paintings of everyday articles, as experienced by a human being\u2019s \u2018unconscious mind","57":"\u2019 Works by Spanish painter Salvador Dali often exemplify the relationship of the mind with the passage of time","58":"In his painting \u2018The Persistence Of Memory\u2019 (1931), Dali revises the imagery of ticking clocks into \u2018melting\u2019 watches, placed in an eerily deserted landscape that also contains a wooden top, a tree branch and mountains in the background","59":"Through this work, Dali symbolically uses the imagery of the watches to refer to the slippage of memory, sleeping and unconscious states of the human mind, and the connection between space and time","60":"The Russian-French artist Marc Chagall once said, \u201cTime is a river without banks\u201d","61":"In a similar way, the reality of time has been captivated in multifaceted and unlimited ways in art","62":"Spectators will perhaps continue to see further engagement with time as a symbol, a theme, a scientific and\/or philosophical concept in art, in time to come","63":"Published in Dawn, EOS, July 31st, 2020","64":"As the world scrambles to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, the most devastating infectious disease outbreak to hit the world in decades, the crisis has revealed a great deal about the gaps in our economic and health systems","65":"At the same time, in the choice of its victims, the virus has also revealed another health crisis raging world over \u2014 that of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)","66":"The evidence emerging from the pandemic makes one thing clear \u2014 people living with or affected by noncommunicable or chronic diseases are at higher risk and far more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from the virus","67":"What are NCDs","68":"According to the WHO, these are long-duration diseases that result from a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors","69":"The major types of NCDs include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes","70":"While previously thought of as a problem for developed countries, NCDs have risen world over in the past 30 years \u2014 driven by urbanisation, globalisation and associated lifestyle changes \u2014 and now kill 41 million people every year (more than 71 per cent of all global deaths)","71":"More than three quarters of NCD-related deaths now occur in low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan","72":"While public health debates in Pakistan have focused more on continuing battles with communicable disease like polio, NCDs, such as heart disease, diabetes and hypertension now contribute significantly to adult mortality and morbidity in Pakistan \u2014 they are amongst the top 10 causes of mortality and morbidity within the country, and WHO estimates indicate that they account for approximately 58 per cent of total deaths in Pakistan","73":"In addition, they impose a heavy and increasing economic burden on individuals, families, communities, and health systems in the country","74":"Over 45 per cent of Pakistani households spend far more on treating NCDs than they do on communicable diseases","75":"Many of these expenses end up being catastrophic, pushing people into deprivation","76":"NCDs have a lot to do with a set of inter-related behavioural, metabolic and environmental risk factors, which greatly increase chances of contracting these diseases","77":"These risk factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and obesity, as well as problems like air pollution and food systems","78":"Prior research has already focused on the dangerous convergence between NCDs and infectious disease","79":"Studies have demonstrated how diabetes patients are more susceptible to diseases like tuberculosis and malaria","80":"As is becoming clear from the emerging clinical evidence on Covid-19, these NCD risk factors can make people more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-19 as well","81":"For example, smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 as they already have reduced lung capacity or lung disease","82":"Similarly, obesity has been identified as one of the risk factors for severe illness from Covid-19 and mortality in younger individuals is higher among those that are obese","83":"Many of these risk factors are increasingly prevalent in Pakistan","84":"Around 24 million Pakistanis smoke tobacco, which kills around 160,000 people a year","85":"Twenty-six per cent of our population is diabetic, one of the highest rates in the world, and obesity is on the rise, with 20 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women in Pakistan being either overweight or obese","86":"A major reason behind these unhealthy indicators is our increasingly unhealthy diet","87":"Consumption of vegetables and fruits in Pakistan has been decreasing amid high consumption of salt and sugar and rising intake of unhealthy processed food products","88":"Another nutritional challenge in Pakistan relates to dangerously high consumption of industrially produced trans-fatty acids (iTFA), a harmful fat found in processed vanaspati ghee, margarines and some cooking oils that greatly increases the risk of heart disease","89":"The excessive intake of TFA in a culture of deep-frying has created a generation of patients suffering from hypertension and heart disease","90":"NCDs are a growing problem and as the coronavirus pandemic has shown, can have devastating mortality consequences if left unchecked","91":"Pakistan\u2019s NCD burden is worsening and puts a large proportion of the population at risk, both from the chronic diseases themselves and from vulnerability to severe illness from infectious diseases like Covid-19","92":"Fortunately, NCDs are largely preventable","93":"Through tobacco use cessation, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, healthy body weight and avoidance of stress, these diseases can be prevented to a large extent, and in the event of disease, suffering and deaths can be reduced","94":"However, this will require concerted policy efforts from the federal and provincial governments as well as cooperation from society","95":"Smart policies can help create a healthier environment for people, including a healthier food environment","96":"This must include policy and regulatory measures to reduce the consumption of excessive salt and sugar and eliminate the use of TFA from our food supply (something the WHO has also called for and our successive governments have also committed to)","97":"This must also include efforts to adequately tax the tobacco industry and unhealthy beverages and earmark those funds for investing in public health","98":"This will create healthier populations less susceptible to NCDs","99":"In addition, there is a need to integrate treatment and prevention of NCDs in the system of primary healthcare (rather than costly late-stage treatment at tertiary care hospitals)","100":"Early detection and management of diabetes, hypertension and other NCDs at the primary healthcare level is cost effective and with early treatment, the needless strokes, blindness, heart failure, end stage renal disease, gangrenous legs, and amputations can be avoided","101":"This must be accompanied by efforts to raise public awareness about risk factors behind NCDs and promote healthy behaviours and lifestyle choices among the population that can prevent the development of these illnesses","102":"In public health, we have always kept infectious and non-communicable diseases in separate silos","103":"Covid-19 has reminded us of the potentially devastating interlinkages between the two","104":"Therefore, the redesign of our health systems in response in a post-Covid-19 context must also include an integration of the battle against NCDs, which has been neglected in public health planning to-date","105":"As we resume the fight for quality universal health coverage in the aftermath of the pandemic, NCDs must be placed at the centre of the debate in order to adapt our health systems to contemporary health challenges so we can make our societies secure and less vulnerable to being ravaged by future outbreaks","106":"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary body on Thursday condemned cyberattacks by Indian spy networks","107":"The chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, Senator Rehman Malik, said: \u201cIndia is involved in cybercrimes worldwide and stealing sensitive national data of various

meetings back in 2018, and had directed the Ministry of Interior to take extraordinary measures to block such attacks","112":"He appreciated the Pakistan intelligence agencies for identifying this major cyberattack by Indian intelligence agencies involving a range of cybercrimes","113":"The issue of placing Pakistan in the FATF\u2019s grey list was also discussed in the committee","114":"Mr Malik said the FATF was playing a discriminatory role and victimising Pakistan while favouring India","115":"He informed the members that he had written a letter to the FATF president, asking him to remove Pakistan\u2019s name from its grey list and proceed against PM Modi for his role in money laundering and terror financing","116":"The Senate committee also considered a point of public

Wednesday, said a US military official","166":"The Wila made no distress calls before, during and after the seizure, the official said","167":"The Iranian helicopter involved appeared to be a Sikorsky

decides to pursue her erstwhile dream for designing","188":"She sets up a studio in a room in her home, creates a collection and invites her family and friends to an at-home exhibit","189":"If she\u2019s good at what she does, the clothes start selling and she begins to plan out more exhibits","190":"Usually, the story ends here","191":"The girl has sporadic exhibits and her fledgling

website, and at our studio in Karachi, via appointment","237":"We\u2019re also constantly participating in major exhibits around the world","238":"I only want to expand to a flagship store when we\u2019re ready","239":"I have two kids and the pace at which we are working right now suits me","240":"I want to open a store only when we have the production capacity to constantly bring out new stock","241":"\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has taught us that we need to be prepared for anything that comes our way","242":"The fashion retail business has been very badly hit, with designers struggling to pay their shop rent","243":"It\u2019s important to know that you should expand your business only when you\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll be able to sustain the additional costs,\u201d she observes","244":"Ansab\u2019s plans include an unstitched formal collection which she plans to launch by next year, on popular demand","245":"Wrapping up the interview, I ask Ansab if she minds that actress Ayeza Khan, who is constantly associated with her brand, also collaborates with a plethora of other labels","246":"Doesn\u2019t it diminish the brand image when the same actress works with multiple other labels on a weekly basis","247":"\u201cWe\u2019re not a high-street brand that can limit Ayeza in an exclusive contract,\u201d says Ansab","248":"\u201cAyeza also happens to be a friend and I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s getting work from other brands too","249":"It doesn\u2019t impact our brand image in any way","250":"When we design for Ayeza, we create bespoke clothes, keeping her personality and looks in mind","251":"People gravitate towards the images because they like Ayeza, but they also like the clothes","252":"The product does matter","253":"\u201dFrom small-scale exhibits to becoming a well-recognised name with a steady clientele, Ansab Jahangir is a young brand that has grown steadily","254":"But in the long run, it still remains to be seen if the designer will be able to move forwards, expanding from online retail and marketing, on to the wider, more competitive platforms of a fashion week and retail stores","255":"Published in Dawn, ICON, July 31st, 2020","256":"While the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc indiscriminately in all parts of the world, it has had a ten-fold impact in most under developed countries and their large populations, paralysing already tottering health and welfare systems","257":"In Pakistan, the outbreak is believed to have caused an economic slowdown that amounts to a staggering loss of Rs2","258":"5 trillion, with about three million jobs likely to be lost at the very beginning; worst affected out of the country's total population are the daily wage earners and those who inhabit the unforgiving urban slums","259":"For years, Pakistan's local charities have been playing a key role in stemming the economic burden on the government by providing meals, medical assistance and other key services to low-income groups","260":"In a bid to help further their cause during these challenging times, PepsiCo, along with the organisation's philanthropic wing, PepsiCo Foundation, vowed to extend support for these charitable organisations as part of their 'Million of Meals' initiative","261":"The idea was to empower millions of dreams, disrupt millions of stereotypes, travel millions of miles to reach all corners of the country, and line millions of spreads, with a vision of providing immediate emergency disaster relief for the many vulnerable, neglected parts of Pakistan","262":"As Covid-19 reduced access to food and other essential goods for communities around the world, PepsiCo invested more than $60 million globally, and catalysed an additional $59 million in funding from others to bring food and other vital resources to the most affected communities","263":"The company is also providing funding for protective gear for healthcare workers, testing and screening services, and is in the process of distributing more than 100 million nutritious meals globally to at-risk populations","264":"In Pakistan, within two months of launch, the initiative has served over 10 million meals with the help of some of the country's most lauded charities in Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir","265":"Lending a hand to the government of Pakistan, PepsiCo has promised over $1","266":"4 million worth of meals and a collaboration with Prime Minister's Ehsaas Rashan Portal, which is run under the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division","267":"All this was not possible without the passion, determination and drive of hundreds of volunteers, PepsiCo associates, workers and support staff, who came together from every corner of Pakistan to lend a hand to the forgotten, the ignored, and the marginalised","268":"Apart from millions of meals, there were also millions of stories","269":"Let's hear them","270":"Empowering minority groups that are often misrepresented and marginalised in a country marred by hunger and poverty is a tough job","271":"Add to that a global health emergency like the coronavirus outbreak and the magnitude of the challenge increases tenfold","272":"Supported by PepsiCo, Orange Tree Foundation took on the responsibility of reaching out to thousands of vulnerable households and transgender communities in Sindh; in Thatta and Badin, Baba and Bhit Islands, Mubarak village, and in Banaras, Orangi Town, Lyari, and other neglected parts of Karachi","273":"The organisation managed this with the help of over 50 volunteers, including a dedicated team of community reps belonging to the transgender and fisherman community","274":"Life in Karachi's busy Port area waits for nothing, and acknowledges no one","275":"People like Abdul Razzak know that all too well","276":"For the inhabitants of Shams Pir village in Bhit Island, Razzak is no less than a saint; this also why they often call him Haji Razzak","277":"Talking about the many struggles of the fishermen and their families at Baba and Bhit Island, Razzak told us, \"80% of these people are so poor that they cannot afford any meals","278":"Their debts are huge and there is no one coming for help","279":"No matter what problems they go through, the people here know they can knock at Razzak bhai's door at any time of the day","280":"I do all that I can to help these people earn a living","281":"\"A senior volunteer, Hanif Majeed, for Orange Tree Foundation and its cause, is a heroic frontliner who did not hesitate in facilitating the relief drive even in the challenging times of the coronavirus","282":"For days, Hanif would run around and personally pack and distribute meals in different areas","283":"Facing numerous unprecedented challenges posed by these tough pandemic times, it was Hanif who would get up as early as 6am and continue distribution of meals at Baba and Bhit Islands till late in the night, without a break or even a hint of a frown","284":"Such is the warmth exhibited by these heroes of Pakistan who know they might remain unrecognised for life, for they seek nothing but smiles and kindness in return","285":"Speaking for Karachi's much ignored transgender community, Zehrish has high hopes from a city that honours nothing but privilege","286":"She believes people can help their community dispel stereotypes, and that alone will empower them enough to find the right job opportunities, the acceptance and social inclusion they've always dreamed of - and some day, the parents who abandoned them","287":"Zehrish led OTF's team to Karachi's Safoora goth, Pehlwan goth, Sachal goth, Bin Qasim Pipri, Baldia town, and Saadullah goth near Hub chauki","288":"Speaking to us about the condition of her community, Zehrish says, \"People have experienced isolation now, but we were born in it","289":"We have no jobs and no houses in the urban, more developed parts of the city","290":"A ton of us are educated and equipped with the right skills to help boost Pakistan's economy, but no one is ready to let us work","291":"\"Zehrish assisted the Orange Tree Foundation in serving millions of meals to the lockdown-struck underprivileged transgender community that awaits nothing but a little compassion and social inclusion","292":"My mother was told to abandon me when I was born with a physical disability","293":"But she said, no","294":"She said, my son will not be a burden, and will grow to make something out of himself and represent people like him","295":"I am here, volunteering for this meal distribution drive, because I feel uneasy when they say I am good for nothing","296":"People like me do not get the same amount of respect or space as other family members","297":"I was surprised to see so many disabled persons show up at the distribution point despite the many challenges of commute, lack of support from family, and stereotypes we experience in everyday life","298":"Zulfiqar Ali played an active role as a community rep and volunteer; he represented disabled people of his community and also gave the team valuable insights on the social dynamics of Sujawal","299":"Reaching faraway, neglected areas of Balochistan, People\u2019s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) is running meal distribution drives in two phases; phase one focused on Killa Abdulla, Panjgoor, Lasbella, Quetta, and Jaffarabad, and phase two aims to include an additional 28 different districts","300":"With each office deploying 10-15 staffers, PPHI was able to address the many challenges that stood in the way; the biggest being identification of beneficiaries via community support groups and district administration","301":"Widows and mothers of four and six respectively, Sherbano and Bibi Ruksana's struggle began as a startled, pandemic-hit Pakistan was locked down earlier this year","302":"After the death of her husband, who was a daily wager, Bibi Ruksana worked in the fields of BHU Segai to earn her daily income; the area is known as a disputed territory faced with multiple tribal issues, which make it hard to transport goods and commute in the township","303":"Upon receiving the support she needed, Bibi cheered and said she will ensure that the supplies last long enough for her household to survive the lockdown, and hopefully the pandemic","304":"At the brink of a nationwide lockdown earlier this year, inhabitants of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,  Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir had a challenging question at hand: will there be food on the tables if their towns are shut indefinitely","305":"Stretched across Pakistan's most breathtaking landscapes, the provinces offer unparalleled peace, beauty and warmth to their inhabitants, but limited opportunities of safe and sustainable income; most underprivileged people here are pushed to survive on daily wages, with scarce resources to counter difficult living conditions","306":"To reach out to these communities, organisations like Al-Khidmat, Mehnaz Fatima Foundation and National Rural Support Program (NRSP) stepped forward","307":"Since most of these households are located in hilly areas, transportation of goods remained one of the key struggles in the process","308":"With the help of around 500 volunteers, these three organisations transported meals to many cities, including Swabi, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Buner, Malakand, upper and lower Dir, Dera Ismail Khan, Astore and Gilgit, and 10 districts of AJK, including Bagh, Bhimber, Hattian, Haveli, Kotli, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Poonch and Sudhnoti","309":"All three are daily wagers expected to feed households of up to 12 members, all by themselves","310":"For Nadeem, Muhammad and Siffat, the pandemic came as an additional burden on the already distressed financial conditions of their household","311":"They ran out of jobs, faced restricted outdoor movement, and worried about the future of their families and the many mouths they have to feed","312":"What's worse","313":"There was no end in sight","314":"Siffat, who is a painter by profession, says, \"Due to coronavirus, I have to stay home and have nothing to do","315":"I feel very helpless","316":"\"  Living in Pothi, Rawalkot, Saima Shafi is a widow who has seen plenty of peaks and valleys in life; she cares for her three children, out of which one is disabled, and has taken up the role of General Secretary for a woman-led local support organisation (LSO) in Rawalkot","317":"Saima feels she has grown immense empathy towards the many marginalised and neglected communities she sees around her","318":"Volunteering for NRSP since 2011, Saima's dedication and hard work, NRSP was able to identify 12 critically poor families who were unable to fight poverty due to the pandemic","319":"For the rest of the world, Covid-19 brought with itself heaps of a deadly virus that harmed their healthcare systems","320":"But for the developing world, the biggest challenge that surfaced was hunger and food insecurity","321":"Leveraging technology, Rizq Foundation joined hands with the Millions of Meals initiative, and registered millions of empty plates on an app and began distributing meals","322":"While most human welfare work on the outside looks like simple math equations, the process on the inside is much different","323":"On the very first day of work, Rizq realised there were plenty of obstacles awaiting response; price fluctuations in the market because people across the country were busy panic-buying and hoarding essentials, and the possibility of duplication of assistance in the selected areas as tons of other non-governmental organisations sprouted to lend a hand","324":"To work this out and ensure transparency, the organisation collaborated with all existing non-governmental organisations in the said areas, and with the help of a specialised app, recorded and shared data, registered all beneficiaries and assigned them QR codes","325":"This ensured accuracy of delivery, and prevented double-counting and misallocation","326":"Part of Rizq Foundation's team of 100 volunteers, Fazal Kabli and Usama Zahid worked relentlessly towards the organisation's mission","327":"With the pandemic happening and all major parts of the country locked down, Fazal and Usama brought infectious energy and a whole lot of passion to work every day","328":"Leaving behind all personal engagements, including university classes and tough schedules, they worked on the distribution drive every day, ensuring there were no hiccups or delays","329":"Apart from the NGOs and the volunteers, the \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is also supported whole-heartedly internally by PepsiCo associates","330":"Many PepsiCo employees donated generously to add more meals for the programme","331":"To facilitate and grow this drive even more, the PepsiCo Foundation announced a generous \u2018Double Match Program\u2019, which means that for every Rupee donated by a PepsiCo associate, another two Rupees will be donated by the PepsiCo Foundation","332":"The combined power of the associates and the PepsiCo Foundation has enabled distribution of an additional 330,000 meals across Pakistan","333":"Pakistan is the land of hopes, aspirations and many triumphs, with which come challenges aplenty","334":"The \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is rooted in PepsiCo's global vision of 'Winning with Purpose', which is the organisation's promise to do all to save the planet and its many communities","335":"PepsiCo's partnership aims to continue its support for charitable organisations that provide millions of meals to millions of communities, helping them ward off hunger caused by complete and partial economic inactivity in various parts of the country due to the pandemic","336":"To sustain these efforts, the company has announced an investment of Rs775 million ($5million approximately) for its multifaceted social impact programs in Pakistan for a total of three years","337":"And the journey has only begun","338":"The next phases of the campaign are already underway; paving a path to millions more meals and smiles in near future","339":"This project is produced in paid partnership with PepsiCo Pakistan","340":"Reported and

been released for the public","342":"Produced under the banner of One Two records, the music video was a collaborative effort by the duo, exploring falling in love and learning to navigate conflict with your significant other","343":"Written, composed, produced and performed by Saeed, Qubool marks Saba's directorial debut in the field of music","344":"Like most of Saeed's songs, the beat's catchy and the endearing Punjabi lyrics definitely pulled at our heartstrings; not to mention, the video plays out like a beautiful short film","345":"Looks like this is another feather in Qamar's hat","346":"Previously, as a brief clip from the video had gone viral, people on social media were enraged, deeming it disrespectful and offensive shooting bits of a music video at the religious site","347":"Qamar clarified that the sequence shot was \"a prologue to the music video featuring a nikah scene","348":"It was neither shot with any sort of playback music nor has it been edited to the music track\"","349":"In an apology that followed, Bilal pledged to make amends","350":"\"As a realisation on our part, I am removing the entire sequence from the video, and assure you that we won't make such mistakes in the near future,\" the No Makeup singer reiterated","351":"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has made Covid-19 test compulsory for patients prior to undergoing surgery at public sector hospitals to know the exact quantum of the infection among the people","352":"The measure has been taken in the fulfilment of the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation in April","353":"\u201cToday, on the first day of reopening of OPD after its closure in April, four of the five patients admitted for ENT surgeries turned out to be positive for Covid-19 in Ayub Medical Complex Abbottabad","354":"All the patients will undergo coronavirus testing prior to their operations,\u201d a senior health official told Dawn","355":"According to him, the Covid-19 has now become part of the pre-screening for all patients undergoing surgeries, like hepatitis B and C","356":"The WHO has been urging the provincial health authorities to escalate Covid-19 testing as the pandemic is still around and more testing is the only way to know about its incidence","357":"Measure meant to ascertain number of infected peopleThe province has now attained the capacity to conduct 8,000 tests per day but there is shortage of swabs and the health department has been trying to collect more samples","358":"Last week, the health department established special counters at the hospitals to subject patients with respiratory ailments and having flu-like symptoms to compulsory testing","359":"Fifty per cent of such patients in Khyber Teaching Hospital and Hayatabad Medical Complex test positive for Covid-19 on average per day","360":"Health officials said that the province conducted 1,382 tests on August 13; 1,579 on August 12; 1,597 on August 11; and 1,659 on August 10","361":"They said that establishment of special counters would lead to increase in testing that was presently less than what the WHO and national guidelines recommended","362":"They said that last week, National Command and Operations Centre recommended setting up special counters to know about the scale of the pandemic through enhanced testing","363":"On August 12, the province recorded only 88 cases and no person died of the coronavirus","364":"The officials said that increased testing was meant to ascertain if the virus had become less infective or patients were not detected due to less testing","365":"In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 1,235 persons have passed away due to the virus with a total of 35,000 cases recorded so far","366":"There is more need to scale up testing to know the prevalence of Covid-19","367":"\u201cOtherwise, we can see a second hot wave of the pandemic which can cost more human lives,\u201d said officials","368":"They said that NCOC also asked all the provinces to increase testing especially after Eidul Azha to know about the number of infected people","369":"They said that after Eidul Fitr, the hospitals were overcrowded by the patients and the seriously-ill patients didn\u2019t find Covid-19 beds because of non-adherence to the social distancing measures","370":"They said that they feared the replay of Eidul Fitr on Eidul Azha too because people usually ignored standard operating procedure","371":"To judge the situation, more testing was important, they added","372":"\u201cAfter starting the general OPDs and elective operations, we would be able to do more testing of patients as kits are available at the hospitals free of cost and results are prepared the same day,\u201d said officials","373":"They added that health department was facing difficulties in contact tracing of the confirmed patients because people avoided being tested","374":"\u201cHowever, the people coming to hospitals with general ailments are willing to be tested","375":"In this way, we can witness increase in the tests,\u201d they said","376":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has so far conducted 226,883 tests; Sindh 852,575; Punjab 801,298; Islamabad 212,002 and Balochistan has conducted 66,107 tests","377":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","378":"Despite being called out for problematic content countless times, Nida Yasir's Good Morning Pakistan continues to bag headlines based on controversial statements, truly believing all publicity is good publicity","379":"In a recent interview with newlyweds Aagha Ali and Hina Altaf,

Aagha","385":"\"I said I don't want anything in this world, only one promise, only one","386":"Please don't get fat, for god's sake","387":"\" In a Pakistani context where expectations of glamourised appearances are conditioned as acceptable parts of relationships, Altaf also mentioned how her husband taunts her between meals, reminding her of the 'promise' she made to him","388":"But why is communication and compromise within a celebrity couple's relationship, a public condemnation affair","389":"In a society that constantly puts women on a pedestal, unrealistic body standards have dominated television screens, Instagram feeds, and our everyday lives like no tomorrow","390":"The brunt of this pressure is especially faced by married, and according to society, plus-sized women - who despite being all rounders, have to prove their worth based on their size","391":"It is deemed natural to criticise, humiliate and often discredit women with feelings of inadequacy if they gain a few pounds","392":"With the way Aagha has demanded, or may I say demeaned, fat women are somehow less desirable and unlovable","393":"Apparently even less acceptable than the prospect of losing an entire relationship, based on just your weight","394":"When you say things on national television in front of millions of people who put you on a pedestal based on your celebrity status, you give out the message that it is okay to glare at your partner's food or use coercive, emotional means to keep a constant watch on what is on their plate","395":"When you laugh it off, you normalise the dynamics of such a behaviour - a relationship based on just obsessing over whether your partner is attracted to you","396":"A relationship, where staying fit and healthy isn't encouraged as a preference or a norm, but portrayed as a condition or intimidating threat","397":"One can be a cheerleader and support system for their partner in their quest for fitness, or one can straight up fat-shame - no points for guessing what this interaction came off as","398":"With physical attraction forming the basis of relationships, change in appearances affects relationship dynamics in grave ways","399":"So what happens if the promise breaks","400":"If a woman indulges in food habits post-maternity, or even as an escape","401":"According to Aagha's explanation, his concern is because \"no producer\/ director\/ writer would like to have an overweight heroine","402":"\" However, his justification only makes things worse if you ask me","403":"Having the resources, the platform and a massive fan following, the duo has the power to advocate for change","404":"To raise important questions, instead of lowering the spirits of the many women watching them","405":"Does your weight define your talent","406":"Is being fat worse than being a toxic partner, objectifying companion or controlling authority in a relationship","407":"(EDITORIAL) Qaid-e-Azam\u2019s speech at Bombay on

Megatron one sees in the new Netflix series Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy, isn\u2019t the growling, one-dimensional mad villain viewers are familiar with; here he\u2019s a solemn leader, drowning in pathos and passionate for his cause \u2014 to return his war-ravaged home world Cybertron to its former glory","417":"His Plan-A is simple: convince the Autobots (for the unversed, they

or the throngs of cartoons, videogames and feature film retellings across mediums","422":"No matter the era or the target audience, war it seems, is inevitable","423":"War for Cybertron (not to be confused with its totally dissimilar, namesake videogame), is a little different than the rest of the fodder","424":"Set primarily in Cybertron, the setting is the near-end days of the collapse of their civilisation","425":"Two principal factors help War for Cybertron","426":"First, the mature storytelling stance delves deep into the backstory and the political upheaval that ruined a once peaceful race","427":"Second, since the setting is millions of years in the past, there are no pesky humans whimpering and cowering about, ruining the action and the scenes (the second argument is primarily reserved for Michael Bay\u2019s movies)","428":"Despite the praise, this new series isn\u2019t perfect, not by a long shot","429":"Coming in behind the unconnected, critically- and audience-panned Prime Wars Trilogy (I liked it), the animation quality, in comparison, is horrendous","430":"Bodies of hard-metal robots twist and turn with the bendy flexibility of a marshmallow

franchise have a better alternative with comic book publisher IDW\u2019s reboot of the series \u2014 not only does the comic series explore the ideological differences of the two factions with

version \u2014 he was a part of an artists\u2019 collective called Paanch, helmed by Babar Sheikh and Omran Shafique \u2014 the latter has now relocated to the United States","722":"The songs in Guzarish are very different from his work with Sounds of Kolachi","723":"Guzarish has songs that are far more simplistic than they would\u2019ve been had this been a Sounds of Kolachi production","724":"For one, there aren\u2019t 10+ singers and musicians vying for space in a three to four minute track","725":"In Guzarish, it feels as if Ahsan Bari has discovered the value of toning it down","726":"The EP opens with the title track, Guzarish","727":"It\u2019s a ballad","728":"It starts off a tad serious but soon the tone changes and the songs gets more uplifting","729":"The song talks about wishing only the very best for those around you and finding hope in adversity","730":"Surely this is a message we could all use in these uncertain times","731":"While the second song, Aashnai, is more like a pop rock song vs a ballad, it essentially carries the same message as Guzarish","732":"There\u2019s an air of optimism in this one","733":"The message: everything will be alright","734":"Ahsan Bari\u2019s five-song EP, Guzarish, is all about optimism, togetherness, and finding joy even in the hardest of timesThe trend of the songs getting peppier as the EP progresses carries forward into the third song, Bandagi","735":"It features Sohaib Lari, Imam Hamdani and Aziz Kazi","736":"It\u2019s a lighter, upbeat, easier-to-listen-to number","737":"Bandagi starts off with very pleasing guitar play, but it moves away from the western pop rock feel of Aashnai and the percussion gives it a very inherently desi vibe","738":"The shehnai is featured very lightly in the song as well","739":"This song is about finding joy and peace by looking inward, especially during difficult times","740":"Khamooshi switches gears entirely from Bandagi","741":"Starting off with a simple acoustic guitar riff it gives off a very eerie alternative rock-esque vibe right from the \u201990s","742":"This was completely unexpected, considering the previous three songs","743":"This is definitely my favourite track from the EP so far","744":"The atmosphere created in the song continues into the second half where he makes his guitar wail, the way they did back in rock music\u2019s glorious decades","745":"There is definitely a touch of longing, loneliness and melancholy in Khamooshi, evident by the chorus and one of the lines from the lyrics: Aao na, gao saath meray\/ Aao na, baithh jao saath meray\/ Haathon mein haath ley ke [Come, sing with me\/ Come, sit with me\/ Hand-in-hand]","746":"Ghamzada mein nahin\/

in an attempt to make his mother completely deaf, there are several customers making a beeline for the Independence Day memorabilia that she is selling on a footpath on main Korangi Road","758":"There are printed Pakistan flags on sticks fluttering all around","759":"There are the Pakistan as well as Azad Jammu & Kashmir flags along with lots of flag buntings, balloons, green hats, star and crescent T-shirts, headbands for girls, bandanas and broad ribbons to tie around the forehead too, wristbands, bangles, tinted green goggles, stud earrings, badges and stickers","760":"Najma says that she is only minding the stall until her husband returns","761":"And where was he","762":"\u201cAt the wholesale paper market to replenish supplies,\u201d she provides","763":"\u201cThe more we sell the more supplies he can buy and bring from there,\u201d she says, adding that Majid, her husband, otherwise works as a plumber\u2019s assistant","764":"\u201cHe takes a break from his other work every year for about two weeks, from August 1 to 14 to sell Jashn-i-Azaadi decorations","765":"We live nearby in Mehmoodabad,\u201d she says pointing across the road in the direction of her area of residence","766":"Najma\u2019s is not the only stall or cart selling Independence Day memorabilia","767":"There are plenty of them also in the commercial area nearby and all over the city, here and there","768":"Nothing costs below Rs50 and from there it goes up to thousands","769":"The flags are the most expensive, especially the bigger ones","770":"\u201cBut you only buy a flag once","771":"Then you can fold it and store it to bring out each year around this time","772":"So it is like an investment","773":"Every year they become slightly more expensive, too","774":"So it is best you buy one now,\u201d argues Mohammad Ali, a young man selling flags near Bilawal Chowrangi in Clifton","775":"Still, if one was really looking for variety as far as all these things were concerned, one had to visit the wholesale paper market on Hassan Ali Effendi Road for oneself for that was where all the action actually was","776":"The head office of VIP Flags, the ones who supply most of the printed national flags to the market, is also located there","777":"Even the overflowing gutters and stagnant water on the street couldn\u2019t keep the customers away from the busy street","778":"Of course, many of them were the ones coming to buy things in bulk to then resell at their individual stalls but there were others too there who bleed green","779":"Looking at the condition of the place and the tremendous rush in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, the police had also made the street a walking zone","780":"There were no cars allowed to drive through anymore","781":"But it was all worth it for the variety available at the Paper Market was nothing like what was on offer at the stalls set up all over the rest of the city","782":"And it was reasonably priced as well","783":"There were plain as well as glass and plastic bangles with glitter","784":"A dozen bangles were selling for Rs50 only and they had them in all sizes, from infant to grownup","785":"The masks and hats were also selling like hotcakes and there was huge variety to choose from like there was for the goggles, badges and hair clips","786":"And they only cost from Rs10 to Rs20","787":"The only problem was that the salespersons wanted you to buy more than one","788":"\u201cBut I only need one pair of green goggles and a hat,\u201d argued one young mother with a salesman","789":"But then after giving it another thought she did buy more stuff than she had initially planned to buy","790":"\u201cIt\u2019s alright","791":"I have so many children in our apartment building who would really love to have these wonderful things but won\u2019t get a chance to come all this way","792":"I\u2019ll just gift them something or the other","793":"Their mothers will be so happy,\u201d she said before helping herself to a packet of shining green stud earrings, bangles, badges and masquerade masks along with a dozen different pairs of green goggles","794":"\u201cOn second thought, I just may set up my own stall in our building courtyard,\u201d she laughed before helping herself to more of the cool stuff","795":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","796":"It was

been planned for a certain outcome \u2014 by both sides, one may add \u2014 or it may have just acquired a life of its own, but the outcome is fairly clear: Ms Nawaz retains the ability to shake things up in a blink of an eye","800":"Many strange things happened that fateful day in Thokar Niaz Beg","801":"When the clouds of tear gas cleared, a few political questions emerged from the haze and din of broken bones and smashed windshields","802":"NAB got bullied","803":"When was the last time this happened","804":"For an organisation that strikes fear in the hearts of mortals (mostly in the opposition), this must have been an alien feeling","805":"Was it planned by the PML-N","806":"Insiders say the decision to take a large number of supporters with Ms Nawaz was aimed to create the right populist optics and thereby inhale some much-needed media oxygen","807":"The last time Ms Nawaz had hit the streets for some high-octane rallies, she had been greeted by a media blackout","808":"Editorial: The situation between NAB and PML-N was ripe for confrontationThis was rather unprecedented","809":"Ever since Pakistani airwaves were filled with private channels in 2002, there were hardly any major events that had been blacked out under duress to such an extent","810":"Contrast this with the end-to-end live coverage of the lawyers\u2019 movement while a general served as a powerful president","811":"The PML-N therefore was smart enough to leverage the opportunity provided by NAB to generate some sound and heat","812":"But what happened was a surprise","813":"The heavy police deployment, the aggressive crowd-management, the fuelling of tempers \u2014 these created a situation that PML-N could only have dreamt of","814":"But the real gift from NAB was offered when it issued a statement saying it would call Ms Nawaz at a later date because the situation had spiralled out of control","815":"Had Ms Nawaz just stared down the fearsome NAB","816":"That is when some sharp political and media sense came into play","817":"Ms Nawaz\u2019s decision to come out of the jeep and speak to the cameras was perfectly timed for maximum impact","818":"\u201cI will stay here till NAB records my statement,\u201d she said defiantly","819":"The tables had been turned and the hunted had become the hunter","820":"This was NAB being bullied like never seen before","821":"For the PML-N, optics could not have been better","822":"PML-N\u2019s trailer","823":"For some months now, many among the party leadership were getting restless","824":"They could sense the heavy cost of quietude bearing down on them with each passing day","825":"Here was this hulk of a party \u2014 with sizeable electoral armour, artillery and infantry in Punjab and Centre \u2014 lumbering along like a gentle giant and allowing itself to be pushed around by all and sundry","826":"In closed door strategy sessions, many leaders would argue for some pushback, some street action, some noise that would remind everyone that the party could still flex muscles \u2014 if not throw a punch \u2014 when it wanted to","827":"To their sheer delight, NAB offered itself as the picture-perfect punching bag","828":"There is as yet no strategic decision about how the party will deploy its strategic weapon \u2014 that being Ms Nawaz \u2014 but Tuesday\u2019s events provided the party an opportunity to show a trailer of what it was still capable of doing","829":"As a bonus, bored party hawks are bored no more","830":"Target locked and loaded","831":"The party of the Sharifs is still plagued with plenty of confusion but one thing is gradually becoming clear: the focus of attacks is shifting away from the Establishment and locking on to two clearly identifiable targets: PTI and NAB","832":"Party leaders will still occasionally fire off a snide remark or a caustic reference towards the \u2018selectors\u2019 but the direction of the main offensive has changed","833":"On Tuesday Ms Nawaz and her colleagues were noticeably silent on the umpire while bowling toe-crushing yorkers at the two players on the crease","834":"What brought about this change","835":"The answer may lie in the slow burning soul searching within senior party leadership","836":"There is as yet, according to party insiders, no clear and categorical decision about any grand strategy","837":"Too much remains uncertain from the party\u2019s vantage point","838":"Mian Nawaz Sharif holds the final call on any strategy but insiders say he is giving space to the party leadership in Pakistan to manage the situation as best as it can","839":"He pats people on the back off and on (one parliamentarian was thrilled when he received a \u2018well done\u2019 message from Nawaz Sharif on an initiative he had taken), but he is not micromanaging the party","840":"Senior party leaders grumble privately that they have not got any \u2018relief\u2019 from the Establishment despite their relative silence, but the prevailing wisdom within the PML-N decision-making circles is to carry on with this policy of restraint till options open up","841":"The leader himself appears fine with this policy","842":"After Tuesday\u2019s show of force, it is safe to assume that PML-N will re-calibrate the heat quotient in its attacks against the two identifiable targets and crank it up a notch or two","843":"APC on the backburner","844":"Since Tuesday many opposition leaders have been heard wondering if the APC has been pushed into the background","845":"While a principle decision to hold the meeting of all opposition parties had been agreed, a firm date is still awaited","846":"Prior to Eid a dangerous rupture had opened up between PML-N and JUI-F when Maulana Fazlur Rehman had accused the two main opposition parties of not consulting his party before deciding to vote in favour of FATF bills","847":"Efforts are under way to stitch up this political wound","848":"However, some influential opposition leaders had been quietly arguing for weeks that APC should come up with some course of action that included hitting the streets","849":"Those who opposed this idea argued that if street power cannot be sustained for a clear outcome, it is a waste of time","850":"After Ms Nawaz\u2019s power show, those arguing for street action would have a stronger case in the APC","851":"Her opponents bowled her a full toss on Tuesday and she middled it","852":"If they are smart, they would want to focus more on their line and length \u2014 and a bit less on the speed","853":"Published in Dawn, August 13th, 2020","854":"Finland plans to reintroduce a recommendation to work from home whenever possible just days after dropping it, due to a rise in

\u201cignoring\u201d the pandemic and arriving at the figure of PBITC \u2014 profit before interest, tax and coronavirus \u2014 rather than PBIT, which is profit before interest and tax","921":"This will give people an idea about the performance of the business precluding the Covid-19 impact","922":"Using this figure, we can adjust all Covid-19\u2013related losses and gains (if any), thus arriving at an actual profit\/loss number","923":"The benefit of this approach is that people will be able to see how financial results would look like in the post-Covid-19 era","924":"This approach

much-needed boost to economic activities","926":"Similarly, Covid-19\u2013specific financial information can be segregated across all reports","927":"This will of course be a deviation from the

attracted the attention of various academics and political commentators","1154":"This topic enjoys a special significance because of a narrative which explains the Sindhi majority of the region as being immune to non-state as well as state-sponsored processes of \u2018Islamisation\u2019 which were initiated from the mid-1970s onwards","1155":"Ever since the 1980s, these processes mutated and permeated society in the shape of religious radicalisation and militancy","1156":"According to Huma Yusuf and S","1157":"Shoaib Hasan, in the 2015 edition of\u00a0Peaceworks, extremism in Sindh is largely centred in the northern areas of the province, such as Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad","1158":"These regions are closest to Southern Punjab and the province of Balochistan","1159":"The studies also agree that compared to rest of the provinces, where cases and episodes of sectarian violence, violence against non-Muslim communities and terrorism by Islamist and sectarian outfits can be traced back 30 to 35 years, extremism is a relatively recent phenomenon in the Sindhi-majority areas of Sindh","1160":"Those who insist that Sindhis were largely immune to the impact of the afore-mentioned processes provide geographical and even theological rationales to support their claim","1161":"For example, the political scientist Mansoor\u00a0Bin\u00a0Tahnoon\u00a0Al Nahyan,  in his 2016 book\u00a0Karachi in the 21st Century: Political, Social, Economic & Security Dimensions, writes that Sindh is not contiguous to Afghanistan or Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), which have been ravaged by years of religious militancy and radicalisation","1162":"According to Al Nahyan, Sindh\u2019s distance from conflict zones in this respect has spared it from the fall-out of such conflicts","1163":"Secondly, Al Nahyan states that Sindhis have historically espoused Sufism and rejected orthodoxy","1164":"Recently, a member of a Sindhi nationalist organisation discussed similar views with me","1165":"When I asked him about the history of religious and sectarian violence in Sindh\u2019s capital, Karachi, he replied by saying that the city had no such history till 1950, or till the Sindhis were in a majority there","1166":"This observation is not that off the mark","1167":"Rita Kothari, in\u00a0Unbordered Memories: Sindhi Stories of Partition, writes, that during the days of the 1947 Partition and the communal violence that it sparked in regions such as Gujarat and Punjab,\u00a0Sindh did not suffer from any virulent fanaticism","1168":"Whatever faith the Sindhis belonged, they were powerfully influenced by Sufi thoughts","1169":"But once there was a mass exodus of non-Sindhi Muslims from India, especially towards Karachi, communal violence did erupt here as well","1170":"However, by then, Sindhis had become a minority in Karachi","1171":"Since the 1980s, Sindh has seen radicalisation and militancy challenging the deep-rooted Sufist creed of the provinceSo, what is happening in the rest of Sindh today, with rising cases of religious extremism and violence, especially in its northern areas","1172":"To this question the Sindhi nationalist was quick to claim that it was the state which was attempting to reshape Sindh\u2019s religious texture, by allowing extremist outfits to set up shop here","1173":"He said the state is trying to defuse Sindhi nationalism in the manner in which it did Pashtun nationalism (in the 1980s) i","1174":"e","1175":"by introducing young people to radical religious and sectarian ideas","1176":"This narrative behind the recent rise of extremism in Sindh is not restricted to Sindhi nationalists","1177":"Some prominent political commentators too subscribe to it","1178":"However, I could only find scant evidence of this during my trips to central and northern Sindh from the late 1980s onwards","1179":"But this does not mean it is entirely incorrect","1180":"Because there is now enough evidence to substantiate that the state did indeed use militant religious indoctrination in KP \u2014 from the days of the anti-Soviet \u2018jihad\u2019 in Afghanistan \u2014 to displace the Pashtun nationalist sentiment and remodel it as something that the state believed it could control","1181":"So why shouldn\u2019t it do the same in Sindh","1182":"As we saw in KP, the state couldn\u2019t control what it encouraged, because it mutated into becoming something a lot more problematic","1183":"The factors behind the rise of religious extremism in some major Sindhi-majority regions of the province are a lot more complex","1184":"For example, names of parties such as PPP, MQM and Sindhi nationalist outfits dominate discourses on the politics of Sindh","1185":"But the name of another important political player in the province always goes missing: the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI)","1186":"The JUI has strong political roots in many northern areas of Sindh","1187":"In his article for the July 18, 2017 issue of\u00a0The News, Mushtaq Rajpar writes that JUI, despite having a Pashtun Deobandi character, was able to root itself in the largely Barelvi Sindhi-majority areas when, in the early 1980s, it played a major role in the often violent PPP-led MRD movements in Sindh against the General Zia dictatorship","1188":"Khalid Mahmood Soomro, a Sindhi from Larkana, became JUI\u2019s main man in Sindh","1189":"He appropriated Sindhi nationalist interests in his rhetoric, for example exhibiting opposition to the Kalabagh Dam and accepting the \u2018shrine culture\u2019 of the region, which is often criticised by the Deobandis","1190":"During the second Benazir Bhutto regime (1993-96) JUI became part of the ruling coalition","1191":"It was during this period that JUI began to build madressahs in northern Sindh","1192":"According to Rajpar, by the mid-2000s, JUI in Sindh started to sound more conservative","1193":"In some areas, it also began to lose its mosques and madressahs to the more radicalised former members of JUI, many of who had merged with or joined banned militant outfits, especially after 2010","1194":"But if it is these elements who have been behind recent bomb attacks on Sufi shrines in Sindh, are they also the ones kidnapping Sindhi Hindu girls and \u2018forcibly\u2019 converting them","1195":"Not quite","1196":"In the 2016 anthology\u00a0Islam, Sufism and Everyday Politics of Belonging in South Asia, the French political scientist Julien Levesque writes that those doing this actually belong to Sufi orders","1197":"Levesque takes a similar route that my 2020 book,\u00a0Soul Rivals\u00a0takes i","1198":"e","1199":"Sufism in Pakistan is a contested space","1200":"This contest in Sindh, as Levesque points out, is between the idea of Sufism constructed by the revered Sindhi nationalist ideologue G","1201":"M","1202":"Syed \u2014 which sees it as a secular expression of Sindhi nationalism \u2014  and the Sufism of some Qadri and Naqshbandi Sufi orders in the province, who are critical of Syed\u2019s notion of Sufism, calling it atheistic and anti-Islam","1203":"The Sindhi politician Mian Mithu, who has been accused of forcibly converting Sindhi Hindus, does not belong to any religious party","1204":"In fact, not only is he a Sufi spiritual figurehead (pir), but was once a member of the PPP","1205":"In the 2018 elections he ran as an independent candidate from a National Assembly constituency in Ghotki","1206":"He lost, but received 91,752 votes","1207":"According to Levesque, till the 1980s, the battle of the Islamic narratives in Sindh was mainly between the Sindh nationalists\u2019 concept of Sufism and the more federal-friendly idea of Sufism of the state and the left-liberal PPP","1208":"But from the mid-2000s, the battle has been about these two concepts struggling to stop being overwhelmed by the more reactionary ideas of Sufism held by the likes of Mian Mithu, and the Deobandi militants who would rather have any idea of Sufism entirely eliminated","1209":"Published in Dawn, EOS, August 9th, 2020","1210":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to have his life story turned into a comic book, as

direction","1309":"Obviously, the legacy of my grandfather is omnipresent in our house","1310":"I was back home playing the piano when my father came up to me and sang the opening line for me","1311":"This was a boyhood dream of my father","1312":"He wanted to be a film composer","1313":"I couldn\u2019t imagine doing the song any way else","1314":"It was also a chance for me to explore my roots and do something different from what I was doing at the time","1315":"Woh Umeed Ki Manzil is a collaboration between musician and music producer and Khwaja Khursheed Anwar\u2019s grandson

the appetite for it","1319":"Rameez: I do think there is space for it","1320":"There\u2019s been tremendous feedback from the diasporic South Asian community with regards to the song","1321":"I think it speaks to that yearning, when you grow up in another culture, to reach back to your roots, despite the complicated relationship you might have to your country or parents\u2019 country","1322":"It

9th, 2020","1356":"Although political leaders have closed borders in response to Covid-19, scientists are collaborating like never before","1357":"But the coronavirus is novel \u2014 and we don\u2019t yet have all the facts about it","1358":"As a result, we may have to change our approach as new scientific data comes in","1359":"That doesn\u2019t mean the science isn\u2019t trustworthy \u2014 we will get the full picture over time","1360":"And there is already great research that can help inform political decisions","1361":"Here are three topics that scientists disagree on","1362":"The novel coronavirus spreads by droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking","1363":"To halt the spread of the virus, face masks have become compulsory in many countries","1364":"But there has been much debate among scientists over the effectiveness of face masks on reducing the spread of Covid-19","1365":"A report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society has come out in favour of the public wearing face masks","1366":"These documents, which have not been peer reviewed, argue that face coverings can contribute to reducing the transmission of Covid-19 if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible","1367":"One relatively small clinical study also showed that infected children who wore masks did not pass on the virus to family contacts","1368":"But the science is complex","1369":"Face masks won\u2019t stop the wearer from inhaling small airborne particles of coronavirus, which can cause infection","1370":"A recent study reported that wearing a mask may also give a false sense of security, meaning wearers may ignore other important infection control measures","1371":"Research has also shown that when people wear masks, the exhaled air goes into the eyes","1372":"This generates an impulse to touch the eyes","1373":"And if your hands are contaminated, you may infect yourself","1374":"Indeed, WHO warns that masks can be counterproductive unless wearers avoid touching their face and adopt other management measures","1375":"We also know that face masks can make us breathe more often and more deeply \u2014 potentiality spreading more contaminated air","1376":"Many scientists therefore disagree with the Royal Society report, requesting more evidence on the efficacy of masks","1377":"Ideally, we need randomised controlled trials involving many people from an entire population to trace how masks affect infection numbers","1378":"That said, other scientists argue that we should use face masks even though perfectly reliable evidence is lacking \u2014 to be on the safe side","1379":"Ultimately though, without a vaccine, the strongest weapons we have are basic preventive measures such as regular hand washing and social distancing","1380":"Immunologists are working hard to determine what immunity to Covid-19 looks like","1381":"Much of the studies have focused on \"neutralising antibodies\", produced by so-called B-cells, which bind to viral proteins and directly prevent infection","1382":"Studies have found that levels of neutralising antibodies remain high for a few weeks after infection, but then typically begin to wane","1383":"A peer-reviewed study from China showed that infected people had steep declines in levels of antibodies within two to three months of infection","1384":"This has created doubt over whether people get long-term protection against subsequent exposure to the virus","1385":"If this study turns out to be accurate \u2014 the result needs to be backed up by other studies \u2014 it could have implications for whether it is possible to produce vaccines with long-lasting immunity","1386":"While many scientists believe antibodies are the key to immunity, others argue that other immune cells called T-cells \u2014 produced when the body encounters the molecules that combat viruses, known as antigens \u2014 are involved too","1387":"These can become programmed to fight the same or similar viruses in the future","1388":"And studies suggest that T-cells are at work in many patients fighting Covid-19","1389":"People never infected may also harbour protective T-cells because they\u2019ve been exposed to similar coronaviruses","1390":"A recent study from Karonliska Institute in Sweden, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that many people who suffered mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 have T-cell-mediated immunity \u2014 even when antibodies can\u2019t be detected","1391":"The authors believe this can prevent or limit reinfection, estimating that one-third of people with symptomless Covid-19 could have this kind of immunity","1392":"But it is not clear yet how it works and how long it lasts","1393":"If this is the case, it is very good news \u2014 meaning public immunity to Covid-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested","1394":"Some have argued it could create \"herd immunity\" \u2014 whereby enough people have been infected to become immune to the virus \u2014 with an infection rate as low as 20 per cent, rather than the widely accepted 60-70pc","1395":"This claim, however, is still controversial","1396":"Immune response to Covid-19 is complex, with the full picture likely to extend beyond antibodies","1397":"Larger studies over longer periods of time must now be done on both T-cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of Covid-19 immunity are related","1398":"The reporting of coronavirus cases varies drastically around the world","1399":"Some regions are reporting that less than 1pc of people have been infected, and others that over half the population has had Covid-19","1400":"One study, which has been peer reviewed, estimated that only 35pc of symptomatic cases have been reported in the US, and that the figure is even lower for some other countries","1401":"When it comes to estimating true prevalence, scientists use just one of two main approaches","1402":"They either test a sample of people in a population for antibodies and directly report those numbers, or predict how the virus has affected a population using mathematical models","1403":"Such models have given very different estimates","1404":"Research led by the University of Toronto in Canada, which hasn\u2019t been peer reviewed yet, assessed blood test data from people across the world and discovered that the proportion who have had the virus varies widely across countries","1405":"We don\u2019t know why","1406":"There could be real differences due to the age, health or spread of each population \u2014 or in policies to control virus transmission","1407":"But it is very likely it\u2019s down to differences in the methodology, such as antibody tests (serological testing): different tests have different sensitivity","1408":"Antibody studies suggest that only 14pc of people in the UK have had Covid-19, compared with 19pc in Sweden and 3pc in Yemen","1409":"But that excludes T-cells","1410":"If they provide a reliable guide to infection, the number may be much higher \u2014 potentially close to herd immunity in some

daughter and 10-year-old son had earlier been taken out of the country for their safety","1567":"Tikhanovskaya decided to run for president after the authorities jailed her husband, popular blogger Sergei Tikhanovsky, and barred him from contesting the election","1568":"He remains in prison in Belarus","1569":"\u201cI know that many will understand me, many will judge me, and many will begin to

not to protest or break the law, apparently reading from a script","1572":"Maria Kolesnikova, one of Tikhanovskaya\u2019s campaign partners, said \u201cwe think this video was recorded under pressure from law enforcement authorities","1573":"\u201d The political novice, who has energised Belarus\u2019s opposition, disappeared on Monday night after spending hours at the central electoral

Linkevicius said Tikhanovskaya had arrived in the EU member country and \u201cis safe\u201d","1576":"EU and Nato member Lithuania, which like Belarus was once part of the Soviet Union, has a history of granting refuge to Belarusian and Russian opposition figures","1577":"Tikhanovskaya went missing as thousands protested on the streets of the capital Minsk, after Belarus decla\u00adred

her claim to have won the election","1579":"For the second night in a row, police used rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas to disperse demonstrations, though protesters fought back with stones and fireworks and built makeshift barricades, reporters, protesters and witnesses said","1580":"The interior ministry said it detained more than 2,000 people","1581":"Published in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","1582":"The Prime minister of Pakistan would like Pakistanis to watch a phenomenally popular Turkish television series called Dirilis: Ertugrul","1583":"Imran Khan has been seen on tape, not only recommending the popular serial but insisting all five seasons should be dubbed in Urdu so that the general public can watch and understand","1584":"This may have come as a shock to the Pakistani drama and filmmakers, who only a few years back had been lobbying to ban or limit Turkish serials like Ask-I Memnu (Ishq-e-Mamnu or 'forbidden love') and Hurrem Sultan because their popularity  threatened to destroy a nascent but still fragile Pakistani industry","1585":"So why does a populist leader like Imran Khan, recommend a foreign television show","1586":"The reason may lie in a much publicised, behind the scenes meeting, where Prime minister Khan met with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad at UNGA","1587":"The idea of an English language channel to counter the rising problems of Islamophobia and the very serious misconceptions about Islam and Muslims at an international level was floated by the three leaders","1588":"An action adventure serial full of sword fights, Dirilis is based on stories of the Muslim Oghuz Turks, fighting invading Mongols, Christian Byzantines and the fanatic Knights Templar Crusaders in Anatolia (now modern-day Turkey) of the 12th century","1589":"To put the timeline into context, Zaheer Uddin Babur, the founder of the great Mughal empire first reached Lahore in 1524","1590":"In 1258, Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad, the great Abbasid capital of the Caliph Haroun Rashid, washing its streets with blood and turning the river Tigris black with the ink of countless priceless books","1591":"Often described as a 'Turkish Game of Thrones', Dirilis has a vast and obsessive worldwide fan following in 60 plus countries","1592":"Apart from diaspora Muslims in the west, the show has gained sweeping popularity in the Middle East, South Africa and surprisingly in South America","1593":"Venezuela\u2019s President, Nicolas Madura is an avid fan and was seen happily wearing the hat of a Turkish warrior or Alp on a recent visit to the sets","1594":"The writer and creator of Dirilis, Mehmet Bozdag is an acclaimed filmmaker with links to Turkeys conservative ruling AKP party, and it is his ability to combine a deeper message of traditional Islamic beliefs with the swashbuckling story of a hero fighting against all odds that is the heart of its success","1595":"High quality production values, talented actors who take their roles very seriously and a director that knows how to keep the audience on the edge of their seats in each episode, you can see why it\u2019s an addictive combination","1596":"The fights are a special feature and the producers spared no expense, using a famous Hollywood stunt team called NOMAD to train the actors and coordinate each clash with the bad guysSet at the crossroads of empires, the show focuses on the figure of Ertugrul Ghazi, his family and friends","1597":"Talking about this character, actor Engin Altan Duzyaten has said, \"He was the father of Osman Gazi, founder of Ottoman Empire, which ruled the world for 600 years","1598":"And, actually, we do not have too much sources about that era","1599":"Our sources are just about 7 pages","1600":"We know that he was a real hero","1601":"For him, the limits were not an obstacle","1602":"\u201cDuzyatan himself is another key to the success of this serial, with only a few pages to go by the actor has created a memorable character, whom audiences root for no matter what background","1603":"Surprisingly non-Muslims are also great fans of Ertugrul, setting aside any cultural bias to enjoy the show for pure entertainment","1604":"Muslims are usually portrayed as barbarians or tyrants in historical portrayals","1605":"Muslim countries either cannot afford to make such epics or filmmakers are not focused on history, hence the colonial, western perspective is dominant and to a certain extent internalised by viewers through constant repetition","1606":"Take for example the recent spate of historical Indian movies; Alauddin Khilji the historic ruler of the Delhi Sultanate is projected as a crazed, carnivorous barbarian in the Bollywood movie Padmaavat","1607":"While Khilji was a hard man, he was not unusual for his times and definitely not the uncultured barbarian that the lens of modern day Indian nationalism projects him through","1608":"For many, watching Ertugrul is like Alice walking through the looking glass; the Muslim characters are the ones making the good decisions, caring for the weak, standing for principles and defying oppression","1609":"As with all fiction, historical accuracy is somewhere in the hazy middle","1610":"Look deeper into the show and you will see that each episode delivers both spiritual and life lessons by allowing principle characters to talk directly about moral dilemmas and their resolution","1611":"Another feature is the use of alims or scholars; in the earlier seasons, a fictionalised version of renowned Islamic scholar and Sufi, Ibne Arabi, is seen advising Ertugrul, while the later series show the local Imam or Khoja gives guidance","1612":"These teachers appear at difficult times in protagonists\u2019 lives and offer explanations of how to deal with the situation with examples from Quran and Hadeeth but most significantly from the life of the Prophet Mohammad (SAW)","1613":"A lot of emphasis is also placed on Hazrat Ali whom the Turkish warriors consider their patron","1614":"The most notable lessons from this serial are: maintain your orientation towards establishing justice, protect the innocent, trust in God and never give up","1615":"Perhaps the most popular quote is \u201cThe victory is not ours, it belongs to Allah\u201d, a sentiment that resonates deeply with many Muslims","1616":"At any given point in the story, Ertugrul is faced by three or even more sets of problems: family issues, conflicts within his tribe, all the while dealing with external enemies like the Templars or Mongols who are always plotting his annihilation","1617":"Interestingly, there is usually a fourth political front, the enemy within","1618":"These are always Turks like Ertugrul , but because of their greed, pride or jealousy they are willing to commit any traitorous act to succeed","1619":"The array of traitors make a fascinating subset of villains: there is Kurtoglu, who is secretly plotting with the Templars and the scheming adviser to the Seljuk Sultan, Emir Sa\u2019d al-Din K\u00f6pek, followed by the almost comically delusional Ural Bey","1620":"One of the most interesting members of this group is Beybolat Bey who played a powerful chief murdering and policing his own people with the enemy","1621":"Like many collaborators, he justified himself that he was saving his people by acting as a buffer with the Mongols","1622":"Writer Mehmet Bozdag has avoided caricatures and created recognisable and surprisingly nuanced villains, who are not necessarily otherworldly evil","1623":"For example, the formidable Nuyan and Aricbuka wish for Mongol dominance and revenge, the crusader Titus is a Templar (the extremists of their time) hoping to ignite another crusade","1624":"All of these villains are brave, intelligent and surprisingly spiritual, often shown praying or meditating","1625":"While this serves as a sly compliment to Ertugrul who can overcome or at the least survive such fearsome and intelligent antagonists, it\u2019s also a reminder that simply being a strong or brave is not enough; protecting the innocent and standing for justice are what sets a real hero apart","1626":"There are many incidents in the early episodes where Ertugrul straightforward approach lands him in near impossible situations but his determination to never ever give up eventually sees him through","1627":"While this die-hard attitude is reminiscent of many heroic figures historical and fictional, what makes Ertugrul so different is that there are many times when courage, persistence, strategy and cunning are simply not enough","1628":"Then its prayer and the guiding hand of fate that make a way out of hopeless circumstances","1629":"Whether he is caught in a poison filled room at Sultan Aziz\u2019s Palace in Aleppo, or literally nailed to stake through his bare hand in a Mongol camp, the power of the prayers of the Sufis and his own direct and sincere supplications to Allah become his salvation","1630":"As in most stories about men, male bonding is a vital element; while ties of blood can disappoint the connection between friends, the brother of choice is what lasts","1631":"Ertugrul often states: \u201cForgiving a traitor is a crime against the innocent,\u201d and this lesson of loyalty is reinforced through five seasons by the unflinching devotion of the Alps, Turgut, Dogan and Bamsi and Abdul Rehman","1632":"The women of the story also provide an intriguing change from the usual orientalist stereotypes of Muslim women hidden in harems","1633":"There is a noticeable change over the season 1, where earlier episodes show the lead female characters like Ertugrul\u2019s wife to be, Halime Sultan with uncovered hair and even short sleeves, towards the latter episodes, the women\u2019s hair is completely under the wrap of rather beautiful Turkish style hijabs","1634":"An interesting historical parallel to this is illustrated by Ira Mukhoty\u2019s book, Daughters of The Sun about the Mughal women and the slow historical slide of Muslim women into the realm of seclusion","1635":"The Mughal women who were also of distant nomadic Chagtai Turkic and Timurid descent, were active, independent and powerful members of the state, their power remained but during Emperor Akbar\u2019s time as Mughals settled into their roles as ruler, they too slid into respectful seclusion","1636":"Powerful and willful, the ladies of Dirilis: Ertugrul are very different to the weeping females we see in Pakistani and Indian dramas but neither do they live up to the Game of Thrones analogy used to describe this show","1637":"The women often act as Beys or chieftains in place of their husbands and brothers as required, they fight with swords or daggers and won't quietly marry any man chosen for them to please anyone even if it\u2019s a sultan","1638":"Despite the supposedly conservative setting and dangerous times, the women travel independently and preserving concepts of honour isn\u2019t at the forefront of their lives","1639":"However, all this freedom is tempered by the way none of the women are allowed to be independent rulers, both Aslihan Hatun and Ilblige Hatun inherit leadership roles but must eventually cede them on marriage","1640":"Obviously the 12th century wasn\u2019t the most enlightened of times but there have been queens throughout history who defied the pressures of the times by ruling independently","1641":"While many hail the show as an example of \u201cIslamic values\u201c, there are a few aspects in the writing which don\u2019t bare up to that declaration on closer inspection","1642":"Islam places great importance on forgiveness but a lot of the action focuses on vengeful justice","1643":"The tradition of the Prophet Mohammad (SAW) also encourages men to consult with their wives but the script doesn\u2019t emphasise this despite giving the women strong roles","1644":"In Turkey, the serial has also been at the center of controversy because members of the secular media have tried to ignore and belittle the series","1645":"At an award ceremony, the team of actors were not allowed to speak despite winning, which outraged fans who claimed the elite, secular left was silencing the more conservative general public who loved the show","1646":"Those familiar with Indian and Pakistani dramas will see some familiar elements with the usual jockeying for position and who will marry whom turf wars but they will also find a lot of positivity and friendship","1647":"Pakistanis will feel particularly at home because one of the leads in the season 5, Beybolat Bey (Ali Ersan Duru) bears an uncanny resemblance to our own Humayun Saeed","1648":"The driving force behind Dirilis' popularity with leaders like Imran Khan may be the the sense of hope and revival against all odds that this story provides","1649":"Mired in difficult times like these, Dirilis seems to provides an inspirational balm to a collectively damaged Muslim psyche that yearns to take its place as a more powerful and productive member of the world community","1650":"Even without the theology, Ertugrul is thoroughly entertaining and represents universal values of good over evil and surviving tough times through perseverance and that can revive the spirit no matter what your faith is or isn\u2019t","1651":"This article was originally published on 15 October, 2019","1652":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to have his life story turned into a comic book,

decided to attend Mount Holyoke, a liberal arts women\u2019s college in the US","1923":"It took her a year to convince her father to let her go","1924":"Four years later, with a degree in economics and international relations, Sadaffe returned home and found herself working for World Bank, a job that\u2019ll take her all over the country, from remote parts of Balochistan to slums in Rawalpindi","1925":"\u201cWorking on these projects was very eye-opening,\u201d she tells me","1926":"\u201cI had never seen such poverty before","1927":"I was working on development projects; there was money coming in, but no tangible impact was being made","1928":"\u201d A dissatisfaction with the social development sector led Sadaffe to seek other opportunities, and a mentor recommended moving to Kashf, a microfinance operation that was then only just getting started","1929":"In the 12 years spent at Kashf Foundation, which has disbursed USD 200M loans to women clients in Pakistan, Sadaffe rose through the ranks to become the COO and later CEO of the organisation","1930":"Under her leadership, Kashf received several awards including the AGFUND International Prize for

which are shared below","1933":"You wear many hats \u2014 businesswoman, entrepreneur, startup mentor and technology advocate","1934":"Which do you feel fits you best (or which do you consider your true calling)","1935":"SA: I think my true calling is really about women\u2019s economic empowerment; I feel it\u2019s essential for a woman to be economically independent because women invest back into the family","1936":"I believe that for Pakistan\u2019s prosperity, we need to bring more women in the work force, especially in the areas of tech and entrepreneurship","1937":"Technology is an equaliser, and it\u2019s an enabler","1938":"If we combine tech and entrepreneurship and give its access to our women, we can make powerful stuff happen","1939":"One of the main things that CIRCLE

contribute to the startup ecosystem of Pakistan, particularly when it comes to female founders","1942":"SA: She Loves Tech is the world\u2019s largest startup competition for women, with participation from over 50 countries","1943":"We first brought the competition to Pakistan in 2017; I was very excited that we got an opportunity to represent Pakistan at this event, because I feel there

so many partners join us on board","1951":"The competition is global, but I have always wondered how we can use it to create inspiration and a movement for women to join the economy and to explore entrepreneurship and tech","1952":"Pakistan has less than 35% women in the workplace, so women are a huge untapped potential in the country","1953":"According to the IMF, our GDP will be boosted by 30pc if we have more women in the economy","1954":"So there\u2019s a very clear economic dividend associated with this and there are many setbacks that hold women back","1955":"We want to get rid of these hurdles","1956":"Another one of your initiatives is the #TechKaro programme","1957":"Can you tell us about this programme and the impact it is making","1958":"SA: With TechKaro, we are giving young women from marginalised communities access to both tech and life skills","1959":"We train them in HTML, CSS, and JAVA, as well as areas like problem solving, collaboration, ethics, and

told my parents, because I didn\u2019t want them to worry, but it showed me what women have to go through on a daily basis","1975":"Women end up paying so much more for transport, just for safety and to avoid harassment","1976":"Workforce safety and security is critical","1977":"Boards and senior management need to pay special attention to the fact that their environment is safe and enabling for women","1978":"It\u2019s just about the simple things, really, like in a KP government office, one woman administrator shared that there aren\u2019t any separate toilets for women","1979":"Access to basic necessities can make a world of difference","1980":"It is also very important that women raise their voice, think through the bottlenecks, and develop the confidence to talk about their issues","1981":"Like on social media, if you raise your voice, companies will pay attention","1982":"We have to build allies; networking is critical","1983":"Speak up, talk to people, say yes to opportunities, have faith in yourself","1984":"Men have lots of confidence, women need to do that too","1985":"We often read about the unique challenges women startup founders face in Pakistan","1986":"But in your years of being a mentor and coach, what have you found is the unique skill or advantage that Pakistani women bring to the table","1987":"SA: The remarkable thing about Pakistani women is that despite our cultural context, there\u2019s a lot of resilience in women","1988":"This can be nurtured with self-awareness tools, and a community they can rely on to motivate and counsel them","1989":"I believe women of our country have tremendous possibilities because you\u2019re so used to working hard, multi-tasking and going the extra mile","1990":"The strength and skills we show in our personal life can prove to be very useful and impactful in the professional space as well","1991":"You have your fingers in many pies these days","1992":"What impact do you hope to have created in 10 years","1993":"And what tangible change do you expect to see in Pakistan\u2019s entrepreneurship landscape in that time frame","1994":"SA: By 2030, I\u2019d really like to see more women who are in leadership roles","1995":"To create an impact, we need more diversity in senior management and governance levels","1996":"For a young woman to be able to dream big, she has to see other women in leadership roles","1997":"As a policy maker, it is essential that anything that is formulated should have women's participation, hence assemblies and national policy making committees need to be inclusive and diverse","1998":"Benchmarks need to be set for higher percentages of women by law","1999":"In the next 10 years, my aim would be to inspire more young women to come into STEM and join the tech workforce, because that\u2019s where the future lies","2000":"We also need to develop men as allies, encouraging boys to respect women, and have them take a bigger role in household responsibilities","2001":"For women, financial independence and stability is absolutely crucial","2002":"You harness the potential of women, you will have a stronger family, you will have a

Anis ur Rahman, the chair of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB)","2013":"Kaavan will be shifted to a sanctuary in Cambodia before September and the board has been ordered by the court to take over the management of Marghazar Zoo as well as oversee the safe relocation of Kaavan","2014":"The judge also instructed that all the 878 other animals held in Islamabad\u2019s zoo be relocated within 60 days of the order","2015":"The ruling was celebrated with enthusiasm in Pakistan and by Kaavan\u2019s campaigners across the world","2016":"But it has also forced many to question the value of such zoos \u2014 especially with dozens of incidents of abuse reported across cities in Pakistan","2017":"A report submitted to the court details the problems with Kaavan\u2019s treatment and was referred to in the judgement","2018":"It states that the elephant lives in conditions \"inappropriate\" to meet his \"physiological, social and behavioural needs\"","2019":"As well as being regularly chained up in a small enclosure, he has been kept in isolation since 2012","2020":"His food is \"substandard\" and \"inadequate\", and his mahouts, or keepers, have a \"negative relationship\" with him","2021":"In 2015, a student called Samar Khan started an online petition, bringing the world\u2019s attention to the elephant\u2019s plight","2022":"Describing his release as \"almost surreal\", Khan, who is now a vet, recalled her campaign","2023":"\"His suffering spoke to a lot of people, and he grew a very passionate fan base, with people protesting outside Pakistani embassies,\" she told The Third Pole","2024":"She then created a Facebook page sharing Kaavan\u2019s story","2025":"The vet said she believed social media was a powerful tool","2026":"It allowed people from all over the

fund the relocation, said Anis ur Rahman","2031":"\"The process is complex and involves a huge amount of paperwork","2032":"After that, specialist vets will assess whether Kaavan is physically and mentally fit for the flight","2033":"If all that is cleared, a steel cage will be constructed and Kaavan trained to go into it \u2014 which could take two to four weeks","2034":"\"Even as many celebrate Kaavan\u2019s impending freedom, Uzma Khan, the director of biodiversity at WWF Pakistan, is sceptical","2035":"She was among those who gave evidence to the court on the case and said transportation can cause huge stress in an animal","2036":"\"God forbid something happens during this transfer, who will take responsibility","2037":"\" she said","2038":"Uzma Khan also expressed concern about whether Kaavan will adjust to his new life, saying, \"Considering the average zoo life expectancy of an Asian elephant, Kaavan has lived most of his life, and efforts should be made to improve his enclosure and provide enrichments so that his quality of life improves and he is more active","2039":"\" The average lifespan of Asian elephants in captivity is 47","2040":"6 years in Europe and 41","2041":"9 years in North America; they can live up to 60 years in the wild","2042":"Classified as endangered, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has put the Asian elephant on the Red List","2043":"The episode, however, has compelled Uzma Khan to reach a conclusion","2044":"\"Our government should make a strategic decision never to get any more elephants for our zoos,\" she said, as the latter cannot meet their \"complex social and psychological requirements","2045":"\" Despite the international attention that Kaavan\u2019s story attracted, little has changed in public zoos in Pakistan","2046":"The recent deaths of other zoo animals have opened up new discussions about whether Pakistan should have zoos at all","2047":"Athar Minallah, chief justice of the IHC, wrote in his 67-page judgement that \"zoos do not serve any purpose except to display their living inmates as exhibits to visitors","2048":"\"In July, a lion and lioness died while being relocated from Marghazar Zoo to a sanctuary in Kasur, Punjab","2049":"The decision to move them \"in this hot and humid weather\" reflected \"incompetency and cruelty\", according to Uzma Khan","2050":"In May this year, a giraffe was found dead at Peshawar Zoo, and giraffes in Karachi and Lahore have also died recently","2051":"Three nilgai, or blue bulls, and an ostrich have died this year at Marghazar Zoo","2052":"In 2018, an Asian lion died of tuberculosis; in 2014 a Bengal tiger died from an unknown illness; and in 2011 four lion cubs died \u2014 all at Karachi

Society","2054":"She made a video showing the tiger\u2019s repetitive pacing inside a barren cage, and visitors provoking the animal","2055":"Uzma Khan said this continuing mistreatment can be attributed to several factors","2056":"For some zoos, such as Marghazar, it is a lack of funds which means there isn\u2019t enough money to care for the animals","2057":"However, she added that for many zoos in Pakistan, the problem is a lack of zoo standards that provide basic husbandry and enclosure specifications according to species and guidance for the management","2058":"The problem is also compounded by untrained zookeepers","2059":"Some keepers, who are often low paid, cannot even read or write, Uzma Khan said","2060":"She said there are zoos around the world that offer training and even scholarships for zookeepers","2061":"\"Our [zoo staff] should be sent there to be able to break away from traditional ways of animal keeping","2062":"Most have no idea about training animals through positive reinforcement, or building a relationship with animals in a positive manner,\" she said","2063":"The public outcry which follows episodes of abuse have forced some to rethink zoos altogether","2064":"\"I say turn [Marghazar Zoo] into a family park where people can have picnics,\" said Islamabad-based architect Muhammad Bin Naveed, a volunteer with the Friends of the Islamabad Zoo, a group of animal lovers","2065":"Echoing this view, IWMB\u2019s Anis ur Rahman said: \"We shouldn\u2019t have zoos and we should not set up more zoos","2066":"\" Keeping animals behind bars, he said, sent all the \"wrong messages to our children","2067":"\" But, Anis ur Rahman caveated, it would be cruel to suddenly set zoo animals free","2068":"\"They would not be able to survive,\" he said, adding that zoos need to be kept until the animals die their natural deaths","2069":"WWF\u2019s Khan position was somewhere in the middle","2070":"\"I have nothing against zoos as they have a huge potential for creating public awareness about animals and animal welfare,\" she said","2071":"Work needs to be done, she said, on creating a database of government and private zoos, as well as individuals keeping exotic animals","2072":"She emphasised the importance of \"zoo legislation and standards\" so that when courts take up animal cases, they look at the wellbeing of all the animals in the zoo","2073":"Similarly, Samar Khan, who \"fell in love with animals by going to zoos\" as a child, said responsible zoos can help with conservation, research and rehabilitation of wild animals","2074":"\"A properly run zoo with good resources can help spark a love for wildlife and conservation among people,\" she said","2075":"Header photo by Muhammad bin Naveed shows Kaavan at the

especially for a developing one which struggles to match its desire for investment-led economic growth with insufficient domestic capital","2147":"This gap is often filled by foreign savings which leads to debt buildup and ultimately burdens future generations and traps economies for decades","2148":"In the past 15 years, Financial Literacy has surfaced as a key determinant of savings behaviour as much of the empirical work in this area has concluded that an individual\u2019s ability to understand economic information aids in making better financial decisions which ultimately translates into improved economic well-being through better debt management, more savings for retirement, and more efficient investment management of savings","2149":"For Pakistan, these findings are of great significance as we have long suffered from foreign savings backed growth spurts which were unsustainable","2150":"The current youth bulge in the country is perfectly positioned to work for the next 30-40 years, which if made financially literate can generate enough domestic long-term savings for Pakistan to sustain high economic growth","2151":"Annamaria Lusardi \u2014 a proponent of financial literacy and one of the pioneer researchers in this area \u2014 in a 2015 paper defines financial literacy as \u201c","2152":"","2153":"","2154":"people's ability to process economic information and make informed decisions about financial planning, wealth accumulation, debt and pensions\u201d","2155":"Taking a similar tone, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s International Network on Financial Education (OECD\/INFE) states that \u201ca combination of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude, and behavior\u201d are necessary to make \u201csound financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing\u201d","2156":"The two key aspects one can gather from above are awareness and action, where awareness comes from knowledge and action based on awareness leads to effective financial management by an individual","2157":"Financial literacy has significance for both individual (micro)economy and aggregate (macro)economy, and the two are connected","2158":"On an individual level, the relevance of being financially literate is much more today than it ever has been because on the demand side more and more people are making financial decisions on their own as they lead independent lives, whereas, on the supply side, there has been significant innovation in financial products","2159":"There is also evidence that especially after the global financial crises of recent memory, people are increasingly being made responsible for their personal finances","2160":"As highlighted by Lusardi and Mitchel (2014), in many countries, employers are constantly preferring private defined contribution (DC) plans against employer sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans, which is essentially shifting the responsibility of investment performance of retirement savings from the employers to the employees","2161":"Thus, individuals are increasingly being entrusted with the task of ensuring that they do not outlive their assets","2162":"This, coupled with continuous innovation in financial products and not enough attention to financial education has essentially led to ineffective financial management, which ends up making people worse off","2163":"Increasingly, people are retiring with higher debts and less savings which makes them financially dependent on the state in the case of countries with well-developed social safety nets and on their children in the case of less developed nations","2164":"On a macro level, ineffective long-term saving practices of households aggregately reflects in lower domestic capital generation for economies","2165":"As highlighted by the OECD in a concept paper in 2012, appropriate investment of household savings has a multiplier effect, providing both government and the private sector with the necessary capital to build infrastructure, generate employment and grow GDP, while also providing households with a nest-egg for future expenses and reducing the tax-burden for future generations","2166":"In economic literature, the theory of consumption smoothening states that to maintain their consumption at a certain level, individuals save money in times of high earnings and utilise it when income falls, usually post retirement","2167":"Modigliani and Brumberg (1954), in their theory of spending concluded that people make intelligent choices about how much they want to spend at each age and would work and tailor their consumption patterns to make provision for their retirement","2168":"Such theories implicitly assumed that all individuals possess the ability to not only understand the need for retirement savings, economic concepts, and continuously evolving financial products but are able to apply this understanding effectively when faced with financial decisions, almost as if it would come naturally","2169":"The reality, however, is quite different","2170":"in 2014, the first comprehensive global survey on financial literacy \u2014 S&P\u2019s Global Financial Literacy Survey \u2014 in 140 countries indicated that only 1-in-3 adults were financially literate","2171":"The survey also highlighted a stark difference between the developed world and the developing world, whereby on average 55 per cent of adults in major advanced economies were financially literate, whereas, in the case of emerging economies, this figure was only 28pc","2172":"The implications of low financial literacy are more serious for these emerging economies, especially in the case of retirement savings, as the absence of formal retirement plans means that either people do not end up with any savings at retirement or accumulate insufficient savings to not outlive","2173":"Due to low financial inclusion, people in developing countries have less access to credit, which means big financial commitments such as education and house-buying are usually done without any element of formal credit","2174":"Although, this results in low accumulation of debt compared to developed countries, where people retire with a significantly higher debt, it also means that by the time people retire they have already spent a majority of their savings, and now will rely on either residual savings or potential financial support from their children to get through their twilight years","2175":"As per the S&P\u2019s Global Financial Literacy Survey, only 26pc of adults are financially literate in our country","2176":"As per the Global Findex 2017, in a country of over 210 million, only 21pc of the adult population has a bank account; 35pc of the adult population saved any money in the past 12 months and just 15pc of the adult population saved for old age","2177":"This is also reflective in investing habits, as only 0","2178":"13pc of the population invests in the local stock market","2179":"For a country with 64pc of the population below the age of 30, these are alarming numbers","2180":"In collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, Pakistan has launched its first National Financial Literacy Program (NFLP) which aims to conduct workshops on financial concepts across the country","2181":"Although, this is a good first step, the approach towards increasing financial literacy should have a more comprehensive and targeted approach","2182":"First and foremost, assessing the gravity of the situation is of paramount importance in order to bridge the gap between what people know and what they should know","2183":"To determine this, an assessment survey is essential","2184":"A survey similar to SHED (Survey of Household Economics and Decision making) in the US by the Federal Reserve, which collects information on expenses, income, employment, housing and neighbourhoods, retirement savings etc","2185":"to measure economic well-being of US households and identifies potential risks to their finances, can be conducted in Pakistan","2186":"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) can conduct it either individually or jointly","2187":"However, data collected from such surveys should be kept confidential as the point of this activity is to help increase financial literacy to impact saving behaviour","2188":"Secondly and most importantly, it needs to be realised that literacy and financial literacy are not the same things","2189":"Even people who possess post-graduate degrees may in fact be completely clueless when it comes to making sound financial decisions","2190":"The reason is the way our educational system is structured; nowhere is it ever taught what to do with your money once you start making it","2191":"Therefore, it is necessary that financial literacy is inculcated in young minds from a very early age, the way every school going child is taught the basic ways of living in society, the efficient use of society\u2019s limited resources should be taught as well","2192":"It should be a part of the curriculum and not covered in a monthly seminar","2193":"On this, we have a great example of Jump$tart \u2014 which runs a personal financial literacy programme for high school and college students in the US","2194":"They even have programmes for pre-primary and primary levels, where students are taught very basic concepts such as borrowing in an activity-based session","2195":"They also offer online financial education resources for teachers and schools which makes adoption by any school or institution much easier when compared to building new resources","2196":"Finally, there has to be a parallel effort to increase an individual\u2019s capacity to save in the form of a higher real income, as equipping someone with the knowledge of financial management without the capacity to apply it would not create much of a difference","2197":"The government with all its relevant departments needs to ensure that inflation for the common man remains in an acceptable range which makes room for households to allocate towards savings","2198":"These two efforts run together will ensure that in times of low inflation people do not go on a consumption spree which has been usually the case whenever inflation has declined and our growth has been primarily led by consumption rather than investment","2199":"Pakistan is at a very crucial juncture, and what we do at this point will determine how we position ourselves for the next 30-40 years","2200":"The youth bulge is our biggest asset, which if made financially literate will generate enough domestic long-term savings for the country to achieve sustainable economic growth for years to come","2201":"LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Thursday released all 58 workers of PML-N on bail who were arrested for attacking a police team outside the office of National Accountability Bureau

know how many new cases have emerged after Eid","2226":"We believe that the government has taken this decision in haste because our upcoming festivals and important events like Independence Day, Muharram and Rabi al-Awwal are very close","2227":"This decision should have been made after these dates,\u201d the PMA said in the statement","2228":"\u201cMajalis, processions and religious

adopt preventive measures,\u201d the PMA added","2231":"It said that it was the responsibility of the government to implement SOPs strictly","2232":"\u201cIt is appreciable that the government will review the situation before reopening schools","2233":"We suggest that corona test (antibodies test) of all the staff, including van drivers and attendants, is done before reopening of educational institutes because one infected person can spread the disease to the whole institution","2234":"\u201d Moreover, it is suggested that educational institutes are reopened stepwise and primary and pre-primary classes are reopened last","2235":"Other countries eased their lockdowns and opened different sectors at a time when their cases decreased","2236":"But now again cases have increased in

phenomenon is not unique to Pakistan","2249":"Shakespeare in Henry VI, for instance, has provided the popular culture with his famous line, \u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers\u201d","2250":"This line spoken in jest by Dick the Butcher, a ruffian character in the play, implies in the play\u2019s context that the killing of the lawyers would smoothen the way for installing the rebel, Jack Cade, as king","2251":"This character is not likable, and his design is gruesome","2252":"But many have expropriated the line to express their frustrations with lawyers","2253":"There are three categories of egregious conduct identified in this article that a few lawyers engage in, which makes them unlikeable; it is particularly the conduct in the third category, however, that implicates the entire legal profession","2254":"Under the first category, a few lawyers may purportedly serve their clients by violating their ethical duties","2255":"In their quest for winning cases, for instance, these lawyers may deliberately misrepresent the facts and law","2256":"They may coach, or worse, manufacture witnesses; or they may fabricate evidence","2257":"The lawyers here transgress the ethical boundaries by distorting the level-playing field, thereby undermining the overall scheme of justice","2258":"The second category includes conduct through which lawyers benefit themselves at the expense of their client","2259":"A lawyer in this category may deliberately not provide adequate representation to their client","2260":"He may file a suit, for instance, but not appear for hearings","2261":"Or may appear for hearings, but not zealously pursue the case, either because of lack of preparation, or worse, due to an arrangement with the other party","2262":"Several lawyers indulge in this category of unethical behaviour collectively when they call a strike and shut down courts, pursuing their own ends instead of those of their clients","2263":"In the third category falls conduct that has an impact not only on the judicial system, but also on avenues not directly connected to the court","2264":"A few lawyers, for instance, may use their status as lawyers to garner undue benefits from, or cause undue harm to, society at large","2265":"The attack on a hospital in Lahore by a mob of lawyers last year was an

land encroached upon from the public, including green belts, footpaths and a football ground","2271":"The encroachment first began in 2013","2272":"The Capital Development Authority (CDA) at the time issued notices, demolished a few constructions, but the district court granted a stay","2273":"In 2017, a few lawyers sought more public land","2274":"This time they faced heightened resistance","2275":"It came not from the courts that sat amidst them, at least not initially, but from the public, the residents of sector F-8, who witnessed the public land receding as the chambers continued to engulf the land around the district courts","2276":"In February 2018, an activist Supreme Court stepped in","2277":"Reports from the CDA were sought","2278":"After hearing the matter through the year, the matter was passed on to the Islamabad High Court in December 2018","2279":"In the same month, however, the CDA received the blessing of the district judiciary and finally conducted an anti-encroachment operation, knocking down a few more chambers","2280":"But a few lawyers would not have it","2281":"A strike ensued that lasted for 40 days","2282":"During that strike it was reported that, at one point, around 20 judges of the district courts were detained in their courtrooms","2283":"Infuriated with the protests, around 60 judges reportedly decided to discontinue

pro-India camps seem to have abdicated their responsibility at a critical juncture","2363":"In all fairness, their only defence is that the BJP-led government in New Delhi imposed unprecedented

newly-introduced J&K Media Policy 2020 is the proverbial final nail in the coffin of press freedom in the region","2406":"Journalism has been murdered","2407":"The policy grants unbridled powers to a

extraordinary circumstances","2667":"\u201dSpeaking about lack of experience among his players, Azhar said: \u201cAs a cricketer you have to meet tough challenges","2668":"Yes we have some inexperienced bowlers and batsmen in the side, but they have tremendous talent and are proving their mettle","2669":"As cricketers you have to look at positive things and our last two series have been very good here in England","2670":"So that is the motivating force for us","2671":"We will bring further improvement in those performances","2672":"\u201cIn batting, we have experienced batsmen like

Ali proved to be the best opening pair in the last home series and they would open in the first Test as well","2677":"\u201cThough  Imam-ul-Haq, as third available opener, has also been doing a lot of

three defeats and a drawn game under his belt","2684":"\u201cIt is an important series and I and Asad Shafiq fully realise that being the most experienced batsmen, we have to perform","2685":"\u201dAzhar observed that the last series between England and the West Indies proved that the role of spinners was quite vital and if Pakistan\u2019s batsmen set a good total on the board, Pakistan had good bowling resources in both spin and fast bowling to defend it","2686":"\u201cYasir Shah is our match winner and as spinner his role is very important","2687":"After watching

students from England and Scotland","2697":"They said that Scotland has succumbed to the public outcry over downgraded qualifications and reviewed the results while in England the government has made a statement permitting students to choose between the awarded qualification, their mock result or a free retake","2698":"Minister says matter has been taken up with Cambridge, hopeful for remedial measuresThey said that while the situation is not ideal, the exam boards and the United Kingdom government has given concessions to students to try and reach the best possible

consideration by the CAIE and these students do not have the right to an individual appeal","2702":"According to Hamid Khan, the father of a protesting student, the CAIE issued a statement on the social networking platform Facebook detailing how their marking system works and have, so far, ignored students\u2019 objections","2703":"\u201cThese students have no voice, which makes it easy for the CAIE to carry on with \u2018business as usual\u2019 without acknowledging the unfair and biased treatment for which many thousands of kids will suffer the consequences for the rest of their lives,\u201d he said","2704":"He added that there is also the concern that in downgrading exam results for international students, the CAIE may be behaving in an opportunistic manner, knowing full well that many students will have to resit very expensive exams that students and their families will have to pay for","2705":"\u201cWe suspect the income from this alone will amount to a great many millions of pounds of additional profit for them","2706":"Complaining to the CAIE only returns a standard \u2018no interest\u2019 reply and they would not give any meaningful thought to complaints","2707":"Cambridge is a private entity and a business partner of private schools working on commercial terms,\u201d Mr Khan said","2708":"The protesting students asked that Prime Minister Imran Khan take up the matter with the British government, saying that the CAIE must be forced to treat them with equal consideration or cancel the CAIE assessment for Pakistani students","2709":"The matter was also taken up in a National Assembly standing committee meeting, during which a group of parents said that Cambridge and all other foreign assessment boards should be registered with the

restricted","2764":"The restriction would be applied for three days until Friday, which she said would be enough time to assess the situation, gather information and make sure there was widespread

was unnecessary and tragic","2790":"It did not have to be that way","2791":"To date, more than 40 countries with varying GDPs, literacy rates, and population densities have used diverse methods to suppress the virus, never letting it reach the levels Pakistan saw in June","2792":"Their daily cases now stand between 0 and 50","2793":"Whether we follow in the steps of these \"winning\" countries,

lives","2797":"Four key interventions stand out as critical to keeping daily cases low","2798":"This is the most essential and misunderstood piece","2799":"The chatter about a state conspiracy to keep testing low is merely a distraction \u2014 the real concern is that tinkering around with a handful of tests is a sure path to accelerating infection","2800":"Regardless of reason, and even with declining cases, testing less is never the right approach in pandemic management","2801":"Without widespread testing, we cannot isolate new cases, particularly the asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic ones, and without isolation we cannot stop the spread","2802":"Testing is the only way to make the disease visible and control it","2803":"Pakistan is neither testing enough relative to its current outbreak, nor does it seem prepared to ramp up testing in case of a new surge","2804":"In the past week, it averaged 21,627 daily tests for a population of 220 million","2805":"This is less than half the mimimum testing advised by WHO in its June letter to the Health Minister","2806":"It is also roughly one-third of neighbouring India\u2019s per-capita testing, even though our per-capita cases still remain 20 per cent higher than theirs","2807":"We are told that testing has gone down because demand for it has decreased","2808":"While lab owners have confirmed this decline in voluntary testing, the key issue is this \u2014 waiting passively for people to show up for tests is not how disease surveillance and control works","2809":"The \"winning\" countries, including low-income ones, all engaged in proactive search and detection of cases","2810":"They continued to ramp up testing as spread slowed down, so that new cases could be contained quickly","2811":"This allowed them to stay ahead of the curve, while we continue to lag behind, playing catch-up with a raging fire","2812":"The Ecuadorean city of Guayaquil recovered from being a Covid-19 hotspot by using mobile medical brigades that went into the hardest-hit neighbourhoods to test and isolate","2813":"In Cuba, door-to-door search for carriers, and assisted isolation of the sick and suspected cases kept total cases under 2,500","2814":"In Ethiopia, community health workers screened 40 million people to contain the spread","2815":"In other words, testing is not meant to be a passive process","2816":"Demand for testing must be grown by increasing community engagement, and re-establishing trust between the health system, the state and citizens so that consensual testing becomes commonplace","2817":"Instead of denying that more testing is needed, public leaders should communicate it as an urgent state goal, so that citizens understand the role of testing in pandemic control, along with their own \nrole in enabling it","2818":"Excess capacity should be deployed in high-risk populations such as health staff, frontline workers, prisons, crowded communities, or to test suspected cases and contacts","2819":"While we are told Pakistan has the capacity for 80,000 daily tests, this has not resulted in actual tests due to deficiency in staff, PPE, supplies and equipment","2820":"Scaling all of this infrastructure in anticipation of future spikes should be priority","2821":"Testing should go hand-in-hand with quick turnaround times and assisted isolation \u2014 two key elements without which testing is ineffective in controlling spread","2822":"These were missing in Pakistan in June, when turnaround times surpassed a week, and fear and mistrust kept infected individuals away from isolation facilities","2823":"In order to control the virus, we must identify Pakistan\u2019s active infection clusters and super-spreading events","2824":"These are the settings and conditions that have played an oversized role in contributing to the country\u2019s caseload","2825":"Dozens of epidemiological studies, research on actual cases and models of the pandemic show that 80% of the infection is caused by 10 to 20% of Covid-19 carriers, at super- spreading events","2826":"These are incredible statistics","2827":"They mean that if we could stop these events, we could crush the curve and stop the pandemic","2828":"We now also understand the conditions that lead to these clusters","2829":"They occur when there is an overlap of the three Cs, which are: closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowds, and prolonged close-contact settings such as close-range conversations","2830":"Identifying and strictly controlling these high-risk settings is so disproportionately effective in controlling spread that it has emerged as the key to controlling Covid-19","2831":"And failing to do so has led to fresh waves for countries like Israel, which brought daily cases to under 10, before going back to 2500 per day","2832":"In this context, it is curious to see a stream of global news about super-spreading events \u2014 meat-packing factories in Germany, church gatherings, food processing plants and prisons in the US, weddings in India, bars and gyms in South Korea, schools in Israel, karaoke parties in Japan, prisons and nursing homes around the world \u2014 but no such stories about Pakistan","2833":"This is not because we have not had any super-spreading events, but because we do not trace, identify or bring them into the public domain","2834":"On the contrary, public leaders have made unscientific claims about high-risk settings such as mosques not having led to any cases","2835":"This is harmful conjecture","2836":"Instead, we need to trust the science of Sars-Cov-2 transmission, and limit or ban settings that are breeding grounds for it","2837":"The post-Ramazan viral explosion can also be explained through this lens, in light of the large religious congregations, crowded malls, indoor family gatherings, Iftaar and Eid parties, and funerals that took place throughout the month","2838":"This created a tsunami of clusters that took over a month to die down","2839":"If rules are not imposed to limit super-spreader events, and investment is not made in surveillance and tracing to identify clusters, it will only be a matter of time before cases spike again","2840":"There is a dire need to get the public on board, regain lost trust and get the messaging right","2841":"Without this, there can be no compliance around testing, tracing, or containment, and repeating the \"strict SOPs\" mantra only offers false security","2842":"Our leaders need to send a unified science-informed message to the nation","2843":"They must take responsibility for the weight of their words, and their role in creating public motivation or complacency, which drives transmission rates","2844":"In this context, posturing cannot be ahead of reality, because public vigilance is based on perception of threat","2845":"We need full honesty, both when trends are positive but more critically, when they are negative","2846":"So far, the state\u2019s response has gone from denial in March and April when there was a real window of opportunity to suppress the virus, to apathy and nihilism in May and June as cases spiraled out of control, to premature and overblown declarations of victory this month as trends improve","2847":"Getting the public on board requires putting richer data regularly in the public domain to inform and motivate","2848":"Daily, regional growth rates and trends for core metrics such as hospitalisations, ICU admissions, test-positivity rates, testing turnaround times, hospital capacity and R0 should be easily accessible online","2849":"These can encourage the public to practice caution in accordance with risk levels in their district, and to share in the victory when trends are positive","2850":"If people can see the metrics on which risk classifications and state decisions are based, trust and compliance will be higher","2851":"Greater transparency will also help build faith that the government is serious about protecting citizens\u2019 lives and livelihoods","2852":"Getting the public on board also requires accurate and simple science communication about important topics such as modes of transmission, asymptomatic spread, immunity and masking","2853":"This communication should evolve with new evidence, and be nuanced enough to take into account the fact that the risks associated with people\u2019s everyday decisions lie on a spectrum; they are not binary","2854":"We need benchmarks and a risk-informed plan for a safe reopening","2855":"The most striking thing about Pakistan\u2019s pandemic response is the absence of any targets or benchmarks in the public domain","2856":"Targets are not reported numbers, but thresholds that we are aspiring to","2857":"What levels of community transmission will make it safe for schools to reopen","2858":"What are our national targets for testing","2859":"What is our R0 at present and what should it be","2860":"What test-positivity trends over what time period are needed for indoor businesses to operate safely","2861":"What regional hospitalisation trends will keep health capacity at safe levels","2862":"Surveillance systems should rank districts on infection severity, allowing them to move between green, yellow and red, with corresponding mobility rules and reopening plans","2863":"Setting dates for reopening regardless of transmission levels, as is currently being done for schools, is tantamount to saying we have given up on protecting citizens\u2019 lives and livelihoods","2864":"Reopening is meant to be a phased process rooted in public-health-backed, clearly-defined benchmarks","2865":"Pakistan\u2019s patchwork reopening thus far has followed no rhyme or reason, let alone be informed by benchmarks","2866":"Clearly-defined benchmarks are vital not only for managing the current outbreak but also for detecting and preventing future outbreaks","2867":"Knowing when to allow more mobility and when to practice more caution is an exercise that will need to be repeated over and over again for the next eight to 12 months, until the test-trace-isolate infrastructure is so robust that new cases fall to single digits, or there is a vaccine","2868":"In summary, Pakistan needs a containment plan that includes these four factors: widespread testing with assisted isolation, identifying and limiting super-spreader events, getting the public on board, and clearly-defined reopening benchmarks","2869":"In the absence of these factors, the pandemic will continue to put our most vulnerable and marginalised citizens at the highest risk","2870":"As Pakistanis, we must ask for more from a government that came into power on the promise of protecting its disadvantaged citizens","2871":"PALERMO: France\u2019s Fiona Ferro became the first WTA champion in five months on Sunday as she overpowered Anett Kontaveit 6-2, 7-5 to win

weekend","2882":"Ferro and Kontaveit wore gloves to handle their trophies","2883":"\u201cI had a good intensity throughout the whole match, I didn\u2019t miss a lot, made a lot of winners, so I\u2019m really happy to have the trophy with me,\u201d said the Belgian-born Ferro","2884":"She struck 51 winners and broke Kontaveit\u2019s serve five times in a clinical display as she clinched the title in one hour 43 minutes on her second match point","2885":"The result ensures Ferro will make her world top-50 debut at number 44 when the latest WTA rankings are released on Monday","2886":"Estonia\u2019s Kontaveit, ranked 22nd, has now lost five of the six finals she has contested","2887":"\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I did too much wrong, she was just too good

Islamabad-based Natasha Humera Ejaz\u2019s (NHE) latest number Abhi Abhi is the second song she\u2019s released as a part of the soundtrack of the award-winning Pakistani short film, The Bench","2893":"The film stars Rubya Chaudhry and Usman Mukhtar \u2014 who has also directed it","2894":"NHE has not only written, produced and performed in two of the songs released from the film, but she is also the music director for this project as well","2895":"Abhi Abhi opens with a light, carefree guitar riff accented with the sound of seagulls in the background","2896":"Then NHE starts singing in her signature breathy way","2897":"She has a very sweet, instantly recognisable voice, but she sings Urdu like it\u2019s her second language, not her first","2898":"The same goes for the songwriting","2899":"That\u2019s a bit distracting at first, but eventually her enunciations grow on you","2900":"But not the lyrics \u2014 they\u2019re overly simplistic and sometimes give the impression of words randomly thrown together but without any real knowledge of how to use the language to add any real depth to the song","2901":"Case in point, this line: \u201cHum hoye mukhatib, jaisay thay Ghalib","2902":"\u201d I just\u2026 they might flow in the correct rhythm musically, but sense they do not make","2903":"But this isn\u2019t just a problem with NHE, we have a dearth of proper songwriters in the country","2904":"There\u2019s such a massive focus on adopting and refining other non-native languages for our global survival that we tend to forget our own","2905":"Until it\u2019s too late","2906":"What Abhi Abhi has going for it is just in its opening riff and NHE\u2019s sweet voice and breathy way of singing","2907":"What it desperately needs is proper lyrics","2908":"Soye Nahin, the other song from the soundtrack of The Bench by NHE evokes a feeling of nostalgia","2909":"It starts with a recording of Bengali master-poet Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Tomar Khola Hawa (Winds of Change) by Adhora Mahpara","2910":"The song, which also includes lyrics in Urdu sung by NHE, incorporates poetry from another one of Tagore\u2019s songs, Purano Shei Diner Kotha, sung by \u2018Anonymous","2911":"\u2019 It\u2019s a beautiful number, overall, but one is assuming the reason behind choosing to incorporate Bengali will finally be revealed in the film","2912":"What we have of The Bench available to the public right now is the trailer","2913":"To the sounds of the opening riff of Abhi Abhi, there\u2019s a visibly older Rubya Chaudhry playing the character of a woman who grits her teeth through the everyday patriarchy she encounters, while doing mundane things which would otherwise be easily acceptable for men \u2014 such as buying two cartons of cigarettes","2914":"Breaking the third wall, Rubya\u2019s character talks about how life is a combination of choices that bring us to the point where we are today, and that she\u2019s made some very bad choices over the course of her life","2915":"Then, she sits on a bench and stares into the camera","2916":"There\u2019s an ominous pause before she launches into the story of her

combined, according to a tally based on official figures","2922":"Spain counts 95 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people, compared to 24 in France, 17 in Britain, 13 in Germany and just eight in Italy, the first country outside of China to be hit hard by the pandemic","2923":"The spike has led a growing list of countries to impose restrictions on travel to Spain, which has nearly 323,000 confirmed cases of the disease, the highest number in Western Europe and 11th highest in the world","2924":"\u201cIt\u2019s a critical moment, we are right at a point where things can get better or worse,\u201d said

to buy food, seek medical care, briefly walk their dog or go to work if they could not do so remotely","2929":"When the lockdown measures were completely lifted on June 21, the country reported just 238 new infections and it had just eight cases per 100,000 people","2930":"But infections have surged since the first week of July, in part because the government \u201crushed\u201d to open the

Covid-19","2931":"Several outbreak clusters have been reported among seasonal farm workers \u2014 who often live in crammed conditions \u2014 since the summer harvest season began, helping fuel the rise in cases, Macip added","2932":"And the start of warm weather has led people to \u201crelax\u201d a bit, in country where physical contact and get togethers with friends and family are common, Macip said","2933":"This helped create a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, Macip said","2934":"He said the best way to curb infections is with more testing, public education campaigns and hiring more people

about 1,500 government-run hospitals on average per day","2939":"However, after continuous decline in coronavirus cases, the health department has asked the medical superintendents of the district and tehsil headquarters hospitals to resume OPDs on limited scale to benefit the patients","2940":"Except for Eye and ENT, all other OPDs have been opened in the district and tehsil level hospitals, according to officials","2941":"The hospitals have been directed to avoid Eye and ENT emergency procedures as these carry high risk of transmitting the virus so these should be avoided unless there is risk of life or losing an organ and shall be conducted with the highest level of care using complete personal protective equipment (PPE)","2942":"Officials said that relevant administrations were

JUI-F\u2019s opposition to FATF-related bills was based on principles","3012":"He said it was not for the first time that Pakistan had been put on the grey list as it had happened earlier, too, and Pakistan was cleared from it, but previous governments had not been blackmailed by the FATF","3013":"\u201cThe JUI-F took a stand on the legislation passed in parliament and opposed these bills as we consider them anti-Pakistan bills,\u201d the Maulana said, adding that parliamentarians were not even consulted over the matter","3014":"Fazl calls the approved bills anti-PakistanHe said the MMA and some other parties were excluded from consultation over these bills and it was against democracy, too","3015":"The JUI-F chief said that Pakistan was making FATF-related laws only under pressure from

scriptures","3046":"Despite his credentials as a conservative, religious scholar, Deputy Nazir Ahmad too fell victim to charges of blasphemy and to book burningTo understand this, we must know about

Hakeem Ajmal Khan, Abdul Majid Daryabadi, Azeem Baig Chughtai and Deputy Ahmad\u2019s grandson, Shahid Ahmed Dehlavi","3048":"All were personalities of considerable repute among the Muslims of India","3049":"The anger of the conservative lot against Deputy Ahmad was led by the Nadvatul Ulema \u2014 established in 1894 by Mubarak Mongeri \u2014 based on two counts: one, Deputy Ahmad had used lax language while translating the scriptures and two, he had written a book, Ummahat ul Ummah [Mothers of the Believers], about polygamy in the early Islamic period","3050":"In both, his diction was more colloquial than formal","3051":"He did not use any respectful prefixes, suffixes and titles with the names of prominent apostles, companions and even prophets","3052":"The book is available online, so anyone can see it is written in a free flowing style in the idiomatic Urdu of Delhi","3053":"Interestingly, most writings about Deputy Ahmad have glossed over this episode in a cursory manner","3054":"For example, in Maulvi Nazir Ahmad Ki Kahani, Kuch Unki Kuch Meri Zabaani [The Story of Maulvi Nazir Ahmad, In His Words and Mine], Mirza Farhatullah Baig writes, \u201cMaulvi Sahib was being widely criticised for his Ummahat ul Ummah","3055":"When I, too, brought up the subject, he said, \u2018I really don\u2019t see what there is in this book that has enraged people","3056":"You have read the book","3057":"So tell me if you found something questionable","3058":"\u2019 I was familiar with his style of writing, so I replied, \u2018Maulvi Sahib, your style of writing has a humorous aspect, which is suitable for fiction, but not for historical works, especially when they concern matters of religion","3059":"The disapproval that people are expressing can only relate to your style of writing","3060":"\u201cMaulvi Sahib said, \u2018There was no such clamour over my translation of the Quran","3061":"People have reservations about that, too, but that\u2019s a matter between you and God, while here we are talking about historical characters \u2014 people\u2019","3062":"\u201d This exchange can be found on page 107 of Baig\u2019s Urdu booklet

is nothing further in the booklet about the controversial episode","3064":"Similarly, Dr Saleem Akhtar, in his article \u2018Kucch Nazir Ahmad Ke Baaray Mein\u2019 [A Little About Nazir Ahmad] does not mention the controversy at all","3065":"Raees Ahmad Jafri, in his eponymously titled article about Hakeem Ajmal Khan, writes: \u201cWe can gauge the religious feelings of Hakeem Sahib by the role he played in the resolution of the controversy that emerged when Deputy Nazir Ahmad published his book Ummahat ul Ummah","3066":"The book, at some points, used an arrogant and disrespectful style and tone that stirred a storm in the country","3067":"Nazir Ahmad\u2019s intentions were good and he never meant to disrespect anyone, but his spicy language and idiom lacked academic grace and he reduced himself to the level of commoners","3068":"\u201cThat is the reason his translation of the Quran was not placed on a higher pedestal, as expected of a scholar of his calibre, who had an impeccable command of the Arabic language","3069":"The controversy created by Ummahat ul Ummah turned the entire country, and especially Delhi, into a volcano","3070":"When the situation became volatile and Nazir\u2019s life was in danger, Ajmal Khan stepped forward","3071":"His friends and foes all believed in his piety and Islamism","3072":"He resolved the matter with a reasonable and acceptable decision that ended the tumult and Deputy Nazir managed to save his life","3073":"\u201d This article appears on page 174 of Shafi Aqeel\u2019s compilation of some rare writings by prominent writers, published by Book Home in 2004","3074":"Shahid Ahmed Dehlavi, in his sketch of Azeem Baig Chughtai, published in the January 1955 issue of the magazine Naqoosh, writes the following: \u201cMaulvi Nazir Ahmad wrote a book, Ummahat ul Ummah, in response to a blasphemous padre who had written insulting remarks against some holy personalities of Islam","3075":"First, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan responded to him and then Nazir Ahmad wrote this book, which was an academic and historical book, but he didn\u2019t use words of respect with any name","3076":"This was taken as disrespect, though Nazir Ahmad explained that, as the book was addressing that Christian padre, so he thought it unnecessary","3077":"\u201cAnd it so happened that many ulema [religious scholars] condemned the book to burning and Deputy Nazir Ahmad was declared a heretic","3078":"Then a responsible leader of the Muslims (Hakeem Ajmal) collected all the copies of that book from Nazir and, without his permission, took them to a large gathering of ulema where Habib Sherwani torched the books","3079":"After this sordid affair, Deputy Maulvi Nazir Ahmad lived for another three or four years, but didn\u2019t write a single word","3080":"\u201dThe writer is a columnist and educationist with a PhD from the University of Birmingham, UK","3081":"He can be contacted at Mnazir1964@yahoo","3082":"co","3083":"uk Published in

turmoil or a bomb blast that took place in another part of the city while fashion week was underway, throwing the audience into a panic","3129":"There is always a chance that a risqu\u00e9 fashion show will get censored altogether and fashion presentations tend to be edited carefully, so that they don\u2019t hurt the sentiments of a demographic dominated by some very strong moral views","3130":"It\u2019s a tricky obstacle course and yet, over the years, fashion has valiantly sidestepped barriers and emerged as a thriving, lucrative industry","3131":"Fashion weeks and couture shows have spurred on business and the occasional collection has pushed boundaries and set trends in motion","3132":"And yes, these fashion forward moments may be few and far between but a trip down memory lane reveals that, long before lawn and bling smothered our senses, they did exist","3133":"Moreover, every now and then, Pakistani fashion has celebrated some proud sartorial moments by making waves globally","3134":"This Independence Day, here are some of the times when Pakistani fashion really made the world sit up and take notice: Dressing Princess Diana when she visited Pakistan back in 1996 has always remained one of designer Rizwan Beyg\u2019s fondest memories \u2013 but it is also one of Pakistani fashion\u2019s proudest moments","3135":"You may have read earlier about how the royal princess came to wear a hand-embroidered ivory achkan created by Rizwan but it\u2019s a story worth repeating here","3136":"Rizwan was asked by Jemima Khan to create a design for a special guest who was flying in from abroad for a Shaukat Khanum fundraiser","3137":"She didn\u2019t reveal the guest\u2019s identity but Rizwan had his suspicions","3138":"He did some research on the princess\u2019 sartorial preferences and discovered that she had a penchant for pearl embroideries and shades of ivory","3139":"The achkan was designed accordingly","3140":"When Diana visited Pakistan, Rizwan met her and when he asked her if she would take a photograph with him, she especially wore the clothes that he had created for her","3141":"Rizwan\u2019s crowning moment, however, was when the Princess wore the outfit twice \u2013 for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital fundraisers in both Lahore and London","3142":"In fact, on the day she signed the papers of her divorce with Prince Charles, Diana later attended the London fundraiser wearing Rizwan Beyg","3143":"It was a day when London\u2019s paparazzi was buzzing and a multitude of her pictures floated out on to media","3144":"And while the princess may have been going through her personal turmoil at that time, she was dressed extremely well, in a design that was entirely made in Pakistan","3145":"Many more local brands got a royal nod of approval during Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s tour through Pakistan last year","3146":"The couples\u2019 team of stylists went on an online shopping spree and visited O\u2019nitaa, a London-based multi-designer store stocking Pakistani brands, collating a select wardrobe for the Duke and Duchess","3147":"The Duchess\u2019 wardrobe was particularly a Pakistani fashion bonanza: accessories by Zeen, a scarf by Bonanza Satrangi, tunics by Ideas Pret and Elan and an entire range from Maheen Khan, including dupattas, kurtas and shalwars","3148":"Her penchant for the dupatta totally won mass approval","3149":"The Prince, meanwhile, opted for his signature shirts and chinos, except when he decided to go all out in a sherwani by designer Nauman Arfeen, in a very Pakistani shade of green","3150":"The pictures floated out extensively on international media \u2013 an acknowledgement of Pakistani fashion and of the rich culture that exists within our land","3151":"Pakistani designers are no stranger to international runways and some of them have been regular participants at official fashion weeks in foreign locales","3152":"Most

by the Council of Aspiring American Fashion Designers (CAAFD)","3153":"2009, however, was the year when three local designers showed complete collections at one of the world\u2019s leading fashion runways, the Milan Fashion Week","3154":"Rizwan Beyg, Maheen Khan and Deepak Perwani were all part of the New Upcoming Designers (N-U-De) category and played to their strengths: Rizwan with a collection in ivory with pearl embellishments, Maheen with a \u2018Khyber Mail\u2019 line inspired by the Khyber and Deepak, with a vivacious mix of colours","3155":"The shows won rave reviews from the international press and one wishes that the designers\u2019 Milan experience had not been a one-off","3156":"Unfortunately, the three designers \u2013 or any others \u2013 have not showcased at MFW again \u2013 although their successes from those long ago shows did help build their businesses further","3157":"Pakistan made its mark in Milan yet again last year when Italian designer Stella

incorporate two local models in her show at MFW: Mushk Kaleem and Alicia Khan","3159":"It was a moment of victory for local craft, being featured on one of the world\u2019s most prestigious catwalks with two of Pakistan\u2019s own as part of the show","3160":"Later, Mushk and Alicia, along with jewellery designer Sherezad Rahimtoola and footballer Karishma Ali, who had helped with the collaboration, posed with the Pakistani flag","3161":"Seeing a familiar logo in a foreign land can trigger a sense of patriotic pride","3162":"A \u2018Khaadi\u2019 logo, for instance, in London\u2019s

contingent of multi-designer store Ensemble","3166":"However, standing out in a league of his own is Faraz Manan who is the only Pakistani designer to have a standalone store in one of Dubai\u2019s most \u2018it\u2019 areas","3167":"The store, with its glossy interiors, is testament to the designer\u2019s considerable Middle Eastern clientele","3168":"It also sets Faraz apart from his peers \u2013 no other Pakistani designer has an international flagship retail presence and there are even only a handful of Indian designers with stores of their own in Dubai","3169":"Finely worked Pakistani couture, evidently, can sell very well in the international marketplace","3170":"Now if only more local ateliers would be able to spread their wings similarly","3171":"It\u2019s about time

from ending the season without a title for the first time since 2014","3185":"They lost the La Liga title to Real Madrid last month and failed to reach the Copa del Rey final","3186":"After champions Liverpool, Real Madrid, and Juventus all exited in the round of 16, Barca will believe they have an even better chance to win a sixth title but they will have to improve significantly to match Bayern who arean 18-game winning streak across all competitions and remain on course for a treble of titles","3187":"\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very complicated,\u201d admitted Barca coach Quique

sounded the alarm after Barca\u2019s rusty performance in the 1-1 draw in the last-16 first leg back in February, saying they stood no chance of winning Europe\u2019s top prize unless they improved","3193":"He would have been worried by Barca\u2019s stuttering start which saw Napoli swarm all over the home side\u2019s area and Dries Mertens clip the crossbar in the second minute with a scuffed shot at Camp Nou","3194":"But Napoli\u2019s slack defending allowed Clement Lenglet to score with a free header 10th minute from a corner before Messi scored a superb second in the 23rd, seeing off four defenders to curl the ball into the far bottom corner","3195":"Messi had the ball in the net again soon after following a superb team move but the goal was harshly ruled out for handball by the Argentine following a VAR review, although Messi later won a penalty which Suarez converted for Barca\u2019s third","3196":"Gennaro Gattuso\u2019s Napoli got one back when Lorenzo

as they had been the better side for much of this Test","3242":"But the loss of several wickets late on Friday during an eventual second innings of 169 cost them dear in a match where Shan Masood made a Test-best 156 in the first innings and leg-spinner Yasir Shah took eight wickets in all","3243":"Pakistan, who have not lost a series against England for 10 years, must regroup quickly before the second Test in a three-match campaign starts at Southampton on Thursday","3244":"\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but not over yet, there are still two Tests to go,\u201d Azhar told reporters","3245":"\u201cThere a lot of positives from this game, we outplayed England on most parts of this Test match","3246":"\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we lost the match in [our] second innings, but we missed a chance to knock England out of the game there","3247":"\u201dPakistan, however, were still in command during an England top-order collapse on Saturday that saw four wickets lost for 31 runs","3248":"\u201cWe were sure we\u2019d wrap it up if one more wicket fell,\u201d said Azhar","3249":"\u201cBut they [Buttler and Woakes] attacked from the off and snatched the game away from us","3250":"Sometimes you just have to give credit to the opposition","3251":"\u201cWe were in control of the game; we were one punch away from finishing the game off, but they came and dominated us during that period","3252":"\u201dAzhar, a specialist batsman, managed just 18 runs in a match where he was out for a duck in the first innings","3253":"But although he has now scored a mere 139 runs in his past 12 away Test innings, Azhar denied captaincy was affecting his batting","3254":"\u201cWhen I bat, I\u2019m not thinking about the captaincy, whether or not I\u2019m out of form,\u201d he said","3255":"\u201cAnd when I\u2019m captain, I don\u2019t think about my batting at all","3256":"\u201dEngland captain Joe Root felt confident about his team\u2019s battling qualities","3257":"\u201cWe knew it would take something special but after last summer it is very hard to stop believing","3258":"It\u2019s a real strong trait of ours,\u201d he said","3259":"\u201cIt was a brilliant chase","3260":"I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the lads,\u201d Root said","3261":"\u201cJos, it shows the mental strength, to play that situation and manage different passages of it, calculating risks, manipulating the spinner, brilliant innings, and Chris was magnificent too","3262":"\u201cThe more important thing is we back it up again, and keep learning, but the clarity with which they played shows the maturity of the group too","3263":"\u201dWith England losing four quick wickets after lunch, Woakes and Buttler had no choice but to reel in the target in one-day mode","3264":"The middle-order pair targeted the Pakistan spinners with drives, sweeps and reverse-sweeps as Azhar lost his reviews in desperation","3265":"\u201cWhen Buttler and Woakes came in and played their shots, they put us under pressure and we couldn\u2019t really answer them,\u201d Azhar said","3266":"\u201cSo credit to them, they outplayed us in that period","3267":"Maybe we were too late to bring fielders up","3268":"\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but not over yet, there are still two Tests to go","3269":"\u201dScoreboard PAKISTAN (1st Innings) 326 (Shan Masood 156, Babar Azam 69,

explanation from University of Health Sciences (UHS) Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Javed Akram for announcing the test of Australian vaccine COVAX-19 on active coronavirus patients in Lahore","3321":"Prof Akram told a media briefing on Thursday that the varsity would test vaccine after preliminary data from its phase-I trials on animals showed it was safe for humans and could generate an immune response","3322":"This Punjab government has now stopped the UHS from testing the vaccine and sought a report from the VC to be submitted to the chief minister and chancellor of the university till Aug 11 and barred him from speaking to reporters till further order","3323":"On Thursday last, Prof Akram said the randomised test of the vaccine would initially be conducted on 50 active Covid-19 patients aged below 60","3324":"\u201cTwenty-five participants will receive two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart, and as many others will be given a placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect, used as a control in testing new drugs)\u201d, he said, adding the patients would then have blood tests to measure their protective antibody and T-cell responses induced by the vaccine","3325":"Reacting to his scheme, the specialized healthcare & medical education department through a Aug 7 letter told the VC for not seeking permission from the Punjab government","3326":"It stated that the announcement of such a trial without any lawful clearance from the authorities concerned has not only caused embarrassment to the government but also caused undue public expectation and general panic","3327":"\u201cThis is prima facie conduct unbecoming of a person of your stature, being vice chancellor of a premium public sector medical university\u201d, reads the Punjab government letter","3328":"The government also raised some questions to be answered by the VC if the clinical trials have been approved by any competent forum in the federal or provincial government before making a public statement or (you) took this decision at your own level","3329":"The letter sought his motives to release such statements to the media as a VC of a public university","3330":"The government asked about the approvals obtained from the competent forum for entering into a clinical\/financial arrangement with foreign entities","3331":"It also linked the VC\u2019s initiative with the unethical and unprofessional act as a senior and seasoned medical professional","3332":"\u201cWhy action should not be taken against you for expressing your views and giving statements on electronic and print media which are against the public policy and are prejudicial to the government stance on such matters","3333":"\u201d the Punjab government says, directing him to submit a report","3334":"Published in Dawn, August 8th, 2020","3335":"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday said that it will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the reduction of batsman Umar Akmal's ban for an anti-corruption breach","3336":"The middle-order batsman was banned in April for failing to report approaches to engage in corrupt practices ahead of this year's Pakistan Super League","3337":"An independent adjudicator last month reduced Akmal's three-year ban to 18 months, saying Akmal's confession that he failed to report match-fixing approaches on two occasions had left \u201cno room for doubt as to the veracity of the charges\u201d","3338":"The PCB said the decision to file an appeal was made following a review of the independent adjudicator's order, which said the ban was reduced \u201con grounds of taking a compassionate view\u201d","3339":"\u201cThe PCB doesn't take any pride in seeing a cricketer of Umar's stature being banned for corruption, but as a credible and respectable institution, we need to send out a loud and clear message to all our stakeholders that there will be no sympathy whatsoever for anyone who breaches the regulations,\u201d the board said in a statement","3340":"Akmal's 18-month ban had been backdated to February 20 when he was provisionally suspended and the 30-year-old will be eligible to play from August 2021","3341":"He last played for Pakistan in a Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka in Lahore last year","3342":"For someone who absolutely loves firangi pleasures like 'brunching', the past five months have been difficult, to say the least","3343":"I clearly did not sign up for a life without poached eggs topped with hollandaise, avocado toast and thick fluffy French toasts layered with cream cheese or Nutella","3344":"I was also shocked that despite not spending on avocado toast for five months, I still haven't been able to afford a house; the millionaires lied to us","3345":"In the first phase of the lockdown, I tried to recreate the brunch experience at home; some attempts more successful than others; but still found myself craving for the good-old-Sunday-brunch at Street 1 in Kohsar Market, Islamabad","3346":"The second phase of the lockdown made me feel like the brunch experience was a distant memory; like something that was a part of a bygone life and I regretted ever taking it for granted","3347":"I should definitely have been more thankful and happier to be served a plate of goodness, that reaches a corner of my heart like nothing else does","3348":"Yet, when the government announced reopening of restaurants, gyms and cinemas, I had mixed feelings \u2014life has begun to get back to normal, but is it too soon","3349":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m against these places reopening","3350":"Most of them are small businesses that have employees, heavy rents and bills to pay and it\u2019s hard to sustain them without a regular stream of income","3351":"Kudos to them for being able to do that for the past six months, but are we responsible enough as citizens to understand the situation and take precautions","3352":"Let\u2019s learn what these precautions and are how we can socially distance","3353":"","3354":"","3355":"but not from great food","3356":"The government imposed and announced some SOPs for the restaurants to practice as it announced the opening","3357":"These include: And finally, While the SOPs look great on paper, we are yet to find out how practical and effective they are in reality, however it\u2019s also important to remember that going the extra mile is always helpful","3358":"Make sure to have antibacterial wipes and sanitizers on you when going out to dine, and avoid touching doors and furniture unnecessarily with hands","3359":"In Paris, stuffed teddy bears are put on chairs to ensure social distancing and if I were going out, I\u2019d definitely take my own teddy with me - but hey, the point is to be careful and know that your safety is your own responsibility before the restaurant's or the state's","3360":"Some of us may be in denial that we won\u2019t dine out but we are all humans at the end of the day and sooner or later we will give in, which may be fine as long as we are careful","3361":"A great way to be careful is avoiding busy times","3362":"It\u2019s valid to want a nice meal after almost half a year but pick a time when you know there\u2019s going to be lesser people around","3363":"Go for early dinner at 6 instead of 8 or 9","3364":"Opt for a late lunch at 3 pm instead of 1 pm when everyone will be looking for a table","3365":"Avoid going to the restaurants on the weekend","3366":"If you dine out during the week, not only are you avoiding the risk and keeping yourself safe but also doing a service to the restaurant by helping them generate sales on a weekday that may otherwise be slow","3367":"Any sane person would wonder why outdoor dining wasn\u2019t opened before the indoor option despite being much safer","3368":"While we don\u2019t put much thought into things, its probably time we do","3369":"While the indoor spaces may seem inviting when you\u2019re deciding to dine out, opt for an outdoor space","3370":"Pakistan may have reopened today but the virus hasn\u2019t disappeared and the last place where you want to be contracting it is at Sunday brunch","3371":"Please avoid it","3372":"Lord knows everyone\u2019s going to be there \u2014we never learn","3373":"That said, I\u2019m not depriving you of avocado benedict","3374":"It\u2019s available at most places on the weekdays too and if you be an early bird and venture out at 8 am on a weekday, chances are you\u2019ll be the only one dining there and acing the social distancing game","3375":"I\u2019m not sure about people in other parts of Pakistan but takeout doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea in Islamabad","3376":"Particularly with all the greenery and hills around","3377":"The safest option is still to get a takeout \u2014doesn\u2019t have to be zinger, it can be sushi too","3378":"Takeout your favourite meal, go to a nearby park if you are craving the outdoors and enjoy your meal in a new way","3379":"It seems strange that people are going crazy about the restaurants opening when all this food was available throughout the lockdown for takeaway, home delivery and later for in-car dining too","3380":"If it was really the food that we are craving, what was stopping them from having it","3381":"International food blogger Foodstravaganza who spends half her time in Islamabad has been showing how to recreate beautiful dining experiences with home delivery","3382":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Sara Arhm, the co-founder of the blog, sets up a fancy dining setting for her family and orders their favourite food for intimate celebrations like anniversaries, birthdays and other moments of joy","3383":"She brings out the stunning crockery, lights on the candles sets a floral centrepiece and enjoys meals from fancy restaurants at home","3384":"She\u2019s showing us the new way of life post-pandemic and makes me wonder how soon all of us can adopt this new lifestyle too","3385":"Her Instagram stories can give great ideas","3386":"The country may be opening today but the responsibility of it not shutting down again lies on the citizens and not the government","3387":"Think wisely, act wisely \u2014we don\u2019t want to be stuck at homes for another five months again","3388":"One of the funniest things I have heard since the government decided to open everything all of a sudden on Monday, 10 August, was a wise one\u2019s tweet that read \u201810th August se naseeb bhi khul jayen toh maza ajaye @ God\u2019","3389":"Well, all I can say is, AMEN to that","3390":"ISLAMABAD: Moody\u2019s on Saturday confirmed Pakistan\u2019s B3 credit rating with a stable outlook as part of the review for downgrade, the agency said in a statement","3391":"Concurrently, the agency has also confirmed the B3 foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for The Third Pakistan International Sukuk Co Ltd, according to press statement received here which added that the associated payment obligations are, in Moody\u2019s view, direct obligations of the government of Pakistan","3392":"The review for downgrade was triggered by Pakistan\u2019s announcement that it would seek to  participate in the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which raised questions that private sector creditors would be asked by the country to extend similar treatment to Pakistani debt","3393":"\u201cWhile Moody\u2019s continues to believe that the ongoing implementation of DSSI poses risks to private creditors, the decision to conclude the review and confirm the rating reflects its assessment that, at this stage, for Pakistan, those are adequately reflected in the current B3 rating\u201d the statement said","3394":"The agency said it remained unclear what influence is being applied to Pakistan and to other participating sovereigns to treat private creditors in a comparable manner to official sector creditors","3395":"\u201cHowever, a number of elements suggest that the probability of broad-ranging private sector involvement has diminished\u201d the rating agency said in its statement","3396":"\u201cThese include the apparent absence of progress in discussions about how private sector involvement (PSI) would be effected in DSSI in general; indications by the G20 that PSI would require the support of the borrowing government; the government of Pakistan\u2019s continued assertion that PSI is not contemplated; and evidence of some debt payments being made to private sector creditors under a DSSI regime\u201d the statement continued","3397":"\u201cThe risks that remain relate to the possibility that in particular cases, DSSI is implemented with private sector creditors also being drawn in to provide debt service relief and incurring losses in doing so","3398":"\u201dThe statement made it clear that the ratings agency is closely watching the actions of the government in its effort to seek debt relief, with particular emphasis on whether or not the government will ask private creditors for debt relief as well at some point in the future","3399":"\u201cThe stable outlook reflects Moody\u2019s view that the pressures Pakistan faces in the wake of the coronavirus shock and prospects for its credit metrics in general are likely to remain consistent with the current rating level\u201d the statement said","3400":"\u201cIn particular, while Moody\u2019s sees downside risks to Pakistan\u2019s economy because of movement and activity restrictions related to the pandemic, which would in turn intensify the government\u2019s fiscal challenges, strong support from development partners including for external financing, coupled with effective macroeconomic policies started ahead of the crisis, contain external vulnerability and liquidity risks\u201d it continued","3401":"Pakistan\u2019s Ba3 local currency bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged","3402":"The B2 foreign currency bond ceiling and the Caa1 foreign currency deposit ceiling were also held steady","3403":"The short-term foreign currency bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged at Not-Prime","3404":"These ceilings act as a cap on the ratings that can be assigned to the obligations of other entities domiciled in the country, the statement added","3405":"Published in Dawn, August 9th, 2020","3406":"IN a meeting held on Tuesday, the Senate Special Committee on Child Protection spoke of the need to strengthen the investigation process in child abuse cases, including addressing loopholes in existing child protection laws and building the capacity of medical and investigative officers to handle such cases","3407":"As the Kasur child sexual abuse ring that was exposed in 2015 demonstrates, in many instances these are not isolated crimes committed by individual assailants, but violations ranging from physical violence to cybercrimes, committed on a massive scale and in collusion with multiple perpetrators","3408":"Tragically, despite the shocking revelations of 2015, or the horrific rape-murder of little Zainab in 2018 \u2014 an event that became the catalyst for the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act \u2014 predators continue to victimise children with a sense of impunity","3409":"Earlier this year, the child protection advocacy group Sahil revealed it had documented at least 2,846 cases of child abuse reported in newspapers in Pakistan in 2019","3410":"The grim reality is that, given the stigma attached to the issue as well as the fact that assailants are often either a family member or closely acquainted with the victim\u2019s family, this figure is a drop in the ocean compared to the actual rate of child sexual abuse in Pakistan","3411":"Similarly, for every case of a child domestic worker being physically assaulted that receives the attention of the authorities and public, there are scores more incidents that go undetected","3412":"Our laws must be strengthened, but it is equally important that attempts to improve legislation not take place in a vacuum","3413":"Laws alone are not enough to guarantee the safety and well-being of Pakistani children \u2014 particularly those who are at higher risk of neglect, abuse or exploitation","3414":"Greater scrutiny and vigilance are needed of schools, madressahs and the places in which children work","3415":"More investment is needed in specialised child protective services","3416":"The debate must continue in order to shine a light on more than just the tip of the iceberg","3417":"Published

England in Southampton on Thursday","3419":"Azhar, who was nearly out for seven, fell for 20 when he edged paceman James Anderson and second slip Rory Burns, who had already dropped a catch, held onto a low chance","3420":"His dismissal meant Azhar had made just one fifty in 11 innings since replacing Sarfaraz Ahmed as Test captain last November","3421":"The Pakistan skipper had come under pressure both as a result of his own form and for the tactics he employed last week during a decisive stand of 139 between Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes that saw England come from behind to win the first Test at Old Trafford by three wickets","3422":"As Azhar walked off, a thunder clap echoed round the Ageas Bowl and soon afterwards rain stopped play with Pakistan 85-2","3423":"Abid Ali, dropped twice in the slips, was 49 not out","3424":"Anderson, who had figures of 2-24 in 12 overs, was now just eight wickets away from becoming the first paceman to take 600 Test wickets","3425":"Pakistan, 1-0 down in the three-match series, were soon in trouble at 6-1 after Azhar won the toss","3426":"By his own admission, Anderson \u2014 England\u2019s all-time leading Test wicket-taker \u2014 had not been at his best at Old Trafford last week","3427":"He came into this match having taken just six wickets in three Tests this season at an expensive average of over 41 apiece","3428":"But England captain Joe Root said on the eve of this match: \u201cTo question Jimmy\u2019s ability and his record \u2014 do that at your own peril","3429":"\u201d  And in humid conditions conducive to Anderson\u2019s swing bowling, the 38-year-old paceman brought one back into Shan Masood to have the left-handed opener, fresh from his Test-best 156 last week, lbw for one","3430":"Pakistan should have been 7-2 but Abid, on one, was reprieved when third slip Dom Sibley dropped an edge off Stuart Broad","3431":"Azhar was on seven when, playing defensively at in-form all-rounder Woakes, the ball trickled onto his stumps without dislodging the bails","3432":"Woakes suffered again when Abid, on 21, got an outside edge only for Burns to drop a slip catch that should have been taken","3433":"Pakistan\u2019s Fawad Alam, 34, has been recalled for his first Test in over a decade","3434":"The inclusion of the forgotten left-handed batsman was the only change to the side as he replaced leg-spinning all-rounder Shadab Khan","3435":"A prolific run-scorer in Pakistan domestic cricket, Fawad played the last of his three previous Tests \u2014 in which he averages over 41 \u2014 against New Zealand in Dunedin, back in November 2009","3436":"England, bidding for a first series victory over Pakistan in a decade, made two changes for a match that is once more being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus","3437":"As expected, batsman Zak Cra\u00adw\u00adley returned in place of Ben Stokes after it was announced the star all-rounder would miss the final two matches of this series for personal reasons after travelling to New Zealand to be with his ill father","3438":"Meanwhile fast bowler Jofra Archer was officially \u2018rested\u2019, with England in the middle of a gruelling schedule of six Tests in seven weeks following their 2-1 series win at home to the West Indies last month","3439":"Archer\u2019s place was taken by left-arm seamer Sam Curran, who has been on the

Mian Anjum Nisar on Tuesday urged the government to control rupee volatility against the US dollar, as the industrial revival and economic growth is impossible without exchange rate stability","3511":"In a written statement, the president of the apex chamber said that Pakistani rupee continued its downward slide against the US dollar, moving in low range of Rs167-168, despite the fact that Pakistan\u2019s current account deficit (CAD) has narrowed by 78 per cent owing to lower imports and better inflows","3512":"He said that the CAD fell to $2","3513":"97 billion during fiscal year 2019-20 while the import bill fell by 19pc to $44","3514":"57bn during this period but rupee continued to sink","3515":"He said that the inflows of workers remittances also grew by 6","3516":"4pc to $23","3517":"12bn during fiscal year 2019-20 which should have a positive impact on dollar-rupee exchange value","3518":"Apart from increasing exports and controlling imports the government will have to take administrative measures, as a large demand of cash dollars are seen in the market, he suggested","3519":"He said that the rupee has dropped by 2","3520":"8pc or Rs4","3521":"55 against the dollar since the start of June","3522":"Nisar appreciated the positive development, related to imports, which have now started decreasing since the last financial year followed by the

should be appreciated but it is also the fact that the much-needed improvement in the CAD was initially achieved by compromising economic growth","3526":"Later, the Covid-19 outbreak slowed down the economy further and caused negative growth for the first time","3527":"Nisar was of the view that State Bank of Pakistan will have to remain vigilant about the mounting recourse to foreign borrowing","3528":"\u201cBesides this, the SBP and the government also need to intervene and come up with policy reforms to control depreciation of rupee which is becoming more and more valueless","3529":"\u201dPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","3530":"ISLAMABAD: With active Covid-19 cases falling below 18,000 in the country, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Saturday directed the provinces to prepare guidelines to manage tourism so that a resurgence of cases does not occur","3531":"The centre pointed out violations of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) at almost all tourist destinations, saying if the situation was not handled properly, a second wave could not be ruled out","3532":"On the other hand, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) has suggested conducting antibodies tests of all staffers before reopening educational institutions","3533":"According to the data released by the NCOC on Saturday, the number of active cases has been

attendants, before resuming educational activities","3541":"The doctors\u2019 representative body said as the government had been lifting restrictions on all sectors for the betterment of people it should save them from coronavirus pandemic as well as the worsening economic conditions","3542":"\u201cIt is appreciable that the government will review the situation before opening schools","3543":"We suggest that antibodies tests of all staff members should be carried out before opening of educational institutions because one infected person can spread the disease to the entire institution","3544":"Moreover, it is suggested to open the educational institutions stepwise: primary and pre-primary classes should be the last to be opened,\u201d PMA secretary general Dr Qaisar

Awwal are very close","3549":"This decision should have been taken after these festivals,\u201d Dr Sajjad said","3550":"He said it had been observed that 80 to 85pc people did not follow SOPs nowadays","3551":"Even in government offices people do not adopt preventive measures, therefore it is the responsibility of the government to implement SOPs strictly, he added","3552":"The PMA secretary general said other countries had eased their lockdowns and opened various sectors when their cases decreased","3553":"But, cases rose again in countries like United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Australia, China and South Korea, he added","3554":"Dr Sajjad said it was a fact that the number of positive cases and deaths had been decreasing in Pakistan since July, but, unfortunately, as

syllabus and for many, college is the first real experience with independence","3579":"She continues, \"We set our own schedules\u2014even small decisions like what to eat or how to spend a Sunday are thrilling","3580":"In my early days at Oxford, a senior student told me that university life is sleeping, studying, and socializing\u2014and you can only pick two","3581":"I found it hard to do even

Tehran","3613":"Published in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","3614":"THE thought of getting the US or other world powers involved in improving the sticky Pakistan-India relationship is attractive, especially when bilateral efforts keep reaching a dead end","3615":"However, experience and history teach us that America or other \u2018influential\u2019 states are not very interested in jumping into the boiling cauldron of South Asian regional politics, and peace will only come to this region when states themselves are ready for it","3616":"In this context, the foreign secretary on Tuesday brought up the Pakistan-India relationship with the American undersecretary of state for political affairs","3617":"As quoted in the media, the foreign secretary told the American diplomat that there was a need \u201cto take steps to prevent escalation of tensions and to facilitate peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute\u201d","3618":"While the government\u2019s sentiment to get Washington involved in order to resolve South Asia\u2019s bitterest dispute must be appreciated, some ground realities ought to be considered","3619":"Ever since independence, America has hardly rushed forward to end the hostility between Pakistan and India","3620":"In fact, when it comes to this relationship, the US has only intervened during times of extreme crisis, for example during the Kargil fiasco","3621":"Moreover, even if the US did come round to committing itself to playing peacemaker in South Asia, the fact is with an election looming in November, no US candidate will have the appetite to commit to this role","3622":"Facilitating diplomatic engagement between Pakistan and India is no easy task, and both major parties in the US will be too preoccupied with their own domestic issues to spend time and energy on South Asian peace","3623":"Also, during an election year, and with a highly active Indian-American lobby, candidates will be looking to grab as many votes as possible, especially from racial\/ethnic blocs, instead of launching risky diplomatic initiatives in a highly unstable region","3624":"If at all, Pakistan should pursue American mediation after the results of the presidential elections are announced","3625":"Secondly, mediation will only work when the other \u2018aggrieved party\u2019 \u2014 India in this case \u2014 is willing to listen to a facilitator","3626":"The BJP-led right-wing government that rules New Delhi has hardly gushed over the thought of making peace with Pakistan, and has in fact rebuffed this country\u2019s efforts","3627":"Moreover, India\u2019s standard, rigid line is that Kashmir is a \u2018bilateral\u2019 dispute, and that third-party mediation in this regard is unwelcome","3628":"If this is the attitude, how can facilitation succeed","3629":"By all means world powers should use their influence with New Delhi to push it towards peace","3630":"But Pakistan should be realistic and not depend on others to improve its ties with India","3631":"The best bet would be to prevent bilateral relations from deteriorating further until a more approachable government takes power in India, without

throats, depleted thoughts and looping answers aside, the combined recording time from four leading ladies, the director and high-ranking executives on both sides of the Indo-Pak border, exceeds six hours by the time I cut Asim\u2019s call","3640":"Just thinking about the amount of information I would have to sift through triggers a throbbing headache","3641":"Still, Asim Abbasi\u2019s new project \u2014 a 10-episode web series produced by Zee5, under its re-launched Zindagi moniker, and sensationally titled Churrails (Witches) \u2014 may very well be worth the trouble \u2026 and an exercise in patience","3642":"As an international project, one specifically made by Pakistani talent for worldwide consumption, there are strict, corporate-led protocols in place","3643":"One misstep may ripple a domino effect \u2014 especially if angst-y questions about Pak-India media rivalries come into play","3644":"At times one needs a chainsaw \u2014 not a knife \u2014 to cut through the anxiety in the air","3645":"Asim Abbasi\u2019s Churrails may very well be an opportunity for the country to build a portfolio that can attract other global platforms to seriously entertain the idea of producing Pakistani contentThe stakes behind Churrails are high, but not because of its subject matter, or its association with an Indian streaming platform inching its way to local consumers at a price point cheaper than Netflix, or the resulting reopening of floodgates of Indian content in Pakistan (one Zee5 subscription gives access to Indian soaps, dramas and movies)","3646":"The issue, disgruntled voices from the industry say, compounds all of these aspects together","3647":"But it only becomes an issue if you let it be one","3648":"Zindagi has been a long-term project","3649":"It bypasses borders and politics, and has a 150 million-strong subscriber base worldwide","3650":"Bad publicity wouldn\u2019t kill the project, but the hit would hurt a lot","3651":"So prudence takes precedence as Zee\u2019s local PR representatives run this writer\u2019s messages back and forth, sometimes in the dead of night","3652":"Information is shared in hushed confidence, some of it cryptic, some redacted even during conversations","3653":"Simple explanations are shielded behind emotionless wordplay out of a corporate press-kit","3654":"It wasn\u2019t helping, and Icon, of course, was not budging from its routine of pursuing the story its own way","3655":"Still, the process of approvals and schedules reminds this writer of prior decade-long interactions with Zee and other film studios, when Bollywood celebrities were interviewed in these pages","3656":"Requests for representatives to silently participate in the interview on conference calls were vehemently opposed by this writer","3657":"This isn\u2019t Bollywood, and while the investment may have been from India, the talent is Pakistani, as are the stories they\u2019re telling","3658":"The only discernable difference is the change in medium, method of delivery and technical terms: streaming replaces broadcasting, internet replaces terrestrial satellites, and cellular (or web-enabled) devices and apps replace television","3659":"Churrails is Asim\u2019s first foray into this strange new world of entertainment","3660":"This endeavour is a risky ballgame that, while set in Pakistan, couldn\u2019t be made in Pakistan","3661":"At least, not for Pakistani television","3662":"A film version would get a serious head-butt at the censors","3663":"Domestic digital platforms, although brave and relatively unregulated by government at this time, don\u2019t have the reach or the funds to present the vision in its entirety","3664":"Now would be the right time to ask the \u2018what\u2019s\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019s\u2019","3665":"I do as well","3666":"Quite often","3667":"On the day of the first interview, this writer called Yasra Rizvi, one of the actors, with barely a smidgen of insight","3668":"Churrails is about four women on the warpath \u2014 though not in the sense one would imagine","3669":"It\u2019s a thriller, not a horror","3670":"But what exactly is it","3671":"With no frame of reference at hand \u2014 images and plot details were kept hush-hush \u2014 this writer had to literally shoot questions in the dark","3672":"The experience made me seethe with frustration","3673":"The pieces eventually connected one by one, through conversations with Nimra Bucha, Sarwat Gilani and \u2014 god bless him \u2014 Asim, who walked me through the plot with as much detail as he could give out, without breaching the contract","3674":"Just minutes before my conversation with Asim, a trailer was shared in private (thanks, again, to his insistence and Zee\u2019s Chief Creative Office, Special Projects Shailja Kejriwal\u2019s timely intervention)","3675":"Words and explanations don\u2019t do justice","3676":"Churrails stars four women \u2014 a lawyer-turned-housewife, an ex-convict released from prison, a high-society wedding planner, and a lower-middle class youngster who\u2019s desperate for a career as a professional boxer (Sarwat, Nimra, Yasra and Mehar Bano)","3677":"The women, reeling from personal miseries, decide to open a detective agency under the pretext of a burqa shop christened Halal Designs","3678":"\u2018Pets and men aren\u2019t allowed\u2019 says the sign at the storefront","3679":"Not all superheroes wear capes, the trailer tells us","3680":"The motive is to help women in need","3681":"Donning coloured scarfs and black burqas, the four ladies tackle cases with a swagger befitting Batman-esque vigilantes","3682":"Women cue up to join this elite underground sisterhood against \u201cmisogynistic

subtexts, visually, there\u2019s too much to take in","3686":"There will be murder and \u2014 presumably \u2014 an abduction","3687":"A cop, on their case, has an assistant with a bit-sized fan keeping his superior cool in the heat (the series is quite lighthearted at first, I\u2019m told)","3688":"Women, in high-fashion dresses and wigs, are rated by (or presumably bet on) by anonymous men in cardboard animal masks","3689":"Other women, clad in burqas, brandishing cricket stumps and hockey sticks, square off against men waving \u2018Death to churrails\u2019 placards","3690":"The series, as mentioned, is 10 episodes long at 50-odd minutes each (with exception to the finale)","3691":"Although it\u2019s women-centric, Asim tells me that his prime motive is to tell an engaging story","3692":"It\u2019s not message-heavy per se, he says","3693":"\u201cI prefer to raise questions,\u201d he tells me","3694":"\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to put Churrails into a genre","3695":"It\u2019s discussing serious issues, but the show itself doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously","3696":"\u201d That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s all fun and games","3697":"The last few episodes lead to a dramatic highpoint, comparable to any high-profile Netflix series","3698":"\u201cThere are themes that make it story-heavy","3699":"Cake [Asim\u2019s critically applauded debut film] wasn\u2019t plot heavy, it was more a study of characters","3700":"Churrails has a lot of plot to it","3701":"The themes here are important, and I want people, who generally don\u2019t watch this content, to watch it","3702":"\u201d Cake had a very long life, and Asim hopes that Churrails, being a web-series, hopefully lives a very long time on the platform","3703":"\u201cAudience\u2019s tastes develop and change","3704":"So, hopefully, those who may not be able to connect with it today, may do so in five or ten years\u2019 time, when their views on life would\u2019ve changed","3705":"\u201dInitially Asim wanted to develop the story as a feature film, but he felt that the story was a little too long for the format","3706":"That is when fate lined up Shailja, who had heard rave reviews of Cake from Mehreen Jabbar and Haisam Hussain, whom she had worked with","3707":"Five or six ideas were exchanged (Shailja wanted to do all of them, she told me earlier in a phone call), and Zee settled on this one","3708":"The experience Asim had is similar to a studio system","3709":"An episode-by-episode series bible was written, followed by a pilot, and then the series","3710":"It took Asim a year to write Cake; he wrote Churrails in six or so months","3711":"Best of all was the fact that there was no creative oversight","3712":"\u201cI really want individual voices to come through,\u201d Shailja tells me on the phone","3713":"\u201cAsim has his own voice, and I want him to write in that","3714":"\u201dAteeq-ur-Rahman, Chief Investment Officer at GroupM,

elusive global appeal","3717":"In fact, in hindsight, Churrails may very well be an opportunity for the country to build a portfolio that can attract other global platforms to seriously entertain the idea of producing Pakistani content","3718":"\u201cContent consumption doesn\u2019t have any boundaries","3719":"In fact, you don\u2019t even see any specific country or language","3720":"Your audience is people who consume your content, irrespective of where they live,\u201d Ateeq explains","3721":"\u201cThis kind of a project hasn\u2019t happened in India as well,\u201d Shailja clarifies","3722":"\u201cChurrails isn\u2019t limiting itself to a particular class, a particular issue, or a particular body type [as in women who look like archetypically-figured, dolled up heroines]","3723":"We\u2019re exploring the story from all points of view","3724":"Most others just show the protagonists\u2019 inner strength, not their vulnerabilities","3725":"\u201d The message is subtle at times, she says","3726":"\u201cHere, empowerment means giving women the right of choices","3727":"\u201dGrowing up in a house of strong women (he has four elder sisters, a very strong mother and a father who is supportive of the women around him), Asim may be attuned to telling female-centric stories","3728":"\u201cIt would be very presumptuous of me to say that I can tell this story better than a woman can","3729":"I have experiences that have shaped my thinking, and that has leaned me towards [particular] stories I want to tell,\u201d he says","3730":"His cast feels that this is one of the best representation of a woman\u2019s point of view they\u2019ve seen till date","3731":"Yasra, who plays Jugnoo, the high-society wedding planner, says that the characters are quite close to real life people","3732":"\u201cThere\u2019s this age-old tradition, where we put women in one of two categories","3733":"Either she\u2019s a pari [fairy], a soft-spoken, beautiful example of modesty \u2014 or she\u2019s an outspoken, opinionated woman \u2026 a churrail","3734":"\u201d There\u2019s no middle-ground, she emphasises","3735":"Asim, Yasra says, doesn\u2019t dilute the essence of these people","3736":"There is no watered-down version of any character","3737":"\u201cIf my character is an alcoholic, you can see she\u2019s an alcoholic","3738":"\u201dNimra Bucha, who plays the ex-convict Batool, says that Asim had very clear pointers at the script level, followed by an intense rehearsal session and constant discussions on characters and motives, both before and in the midst of production","3739":"\u201cThis woman is too sure of herself,\u201d she tells me of Batool","3740":"\u201cShe\u2019s all the things I would aspire to","3741":"She\u2019s single-minded, has a purpose, isn\u2019t apologetic","3742":"She may seem hardened, or cynical, but she is not","3743":"She likes watching cartoons","3744":"She\u2019s not a busybody, nor is she affected by small problems","3745":"\u201cI know a lot of artists say this, but I felt I carried a lot of the clarity from Batool, even months after filming wrapped","3746":"She\u2019s probably the most complex and the quietest character I\u2019ve played,\u201d Nimra tells me","3747":"With the series scheduled to wrap within three months, stress was a routine companion","3748":"Despite what everyone tells me, Asim tells me that, internally, he\u2019s a nervous wreck who feels he\u2019s constantly failing in delivering his vision","3749":"It\u2019s only when he gets to the edit that he lets out a sigh of relief","3750":"Speaking about a different type of grueling experience, there\u2019s Mehar Bano","3751":"Bano \u2014 as she\u2019s called by everyone \u2014 who plays Zubaida, a young boxer and one of the four key members of the cast, writes in a long message that she went to Lyari for four months, where she trained as a boxer","3752":"\u201cThe process was brutal for me, to say the least, considering I have never put in this much effort for any character I\u2019ve done","3753":"I was injured, bruised and battered but, as per the spirit of the character, I kept going","3754":"The process gave me inimitable strength and I channeled all of that back into Zubaida,\u201d she writes","3755":"\u201cWhat I love is how we developed this unbreakable bond of sisterhood while shooting","3756":"Not just the four \u2018churrails\u2019 but the entire ensemble cast","3757":"They would go out of their way to help whoever was struggling","3758":"I once sustained a very serious injury on-set and each of the women came to my rescue immediately,\u201d she recalls in the message","3759":"The last stop of my conversation takes me to Sarwat, barely an hour after finishing up with Asim","3760":"Her first words on the phone are to enquire if I have finished my PhD of the series","3761":"I had","3762":"Sarwat and I discuss her role: Sarah is a criminal lawyer whose husband Jamil (Omair Rana), a lawyer, gives her all the comforts of life but, in turn, subjugates her to a life of domestic servitude","3763":"As if this weren\u2019t enough, Jamil is an unrelenting infidelity machine, texting lewd messages to 75 women, from Larkana to London","3764":"\u201cHumiliated, absolutely violated, Sarah feels really angry at her own self first, then Jamil,\u201d Sarwat tells me","3765":"\u201cThere\u2019s a whole circle she goes through","3766":"She\u2019s a little timid at first, and then a new Sarah comes out","3767":"She embarks on a journey of self-discovery, and realises that many more women need rescuing around her","3768":"\u201cChurrails is about strong women who protect each other","3769":"It\u2019s time we stop playing the victim","3770":"We\u2019re talking about awareness and inclusion","3771":"Today, a high-society girl wouldn\u2019t feel ashamed drinking tea with a lower-middle class woman","3772":"It takes a lot of uplifting for a woman to stand up to a society like this,\u201d she continues","3773":"Her train of thought \u2014 but not her words \u2014 harmonising with Yasra, Nimra, Bano, Shailja, Ateeq and Asim\u2019s replies, as if they have a shared belief","3774":"One other aspect that harmonises \u2014 especially between the cast and the director \u2014 is that they are all fed up with television\u2019s \u2018mazloom aurat\u2019 [poor, subjugated woman] narrative","3775":"\u201cWe\u2019re not asking anyone to empower anyone","3776":"We\u2019re asking women to empower themselves,\u201d Shailja tells me earlier","3777":"The hard sell seems to work","3778":"To break new grounds, Zee Zindagi needs striking projects to buzz-up the market","3779":"Judging from the trailer, and the conversations, Churrails, which debuts on August 11, seems to be ticking all the right boxes","3780":"Now, all one has to do is see the finished product","3781":"Published in Dawn, ICON, July 31st,

in over 53 years","3851":"This will offer an insight into big power dynamics at the multilateral level and also help to draw lessons from a key meeting in Kashmir\u2019s diplomatic history","3852":"India\u2019s actions in occupied Kashmir had created a dangerous situation in violation of UNSC resolutions, obliging Pakistan to take the issue to the world\u2019s highest diplomatic forum \u2014 the Security Council","3853":"It was an arduous path to a meeting, which should have been called without a hitch, as Kashmir remains among the oldest items on the UNSC agenda","3854":"What made it especially challenging was that Pakistan was not a member of the Council","3855":"Then there was the challenge posed by what for over 72 years has prevented implementation of UNSC resolutions on Kashmir: big power interests reflected in the positions of the Council\u2019s five permanent members (P5)","3856":"For example, after India reneged on its pledge to hold a plebiscite, the Soviet Union acted as the prime protector of India\u2019s interests on Kashmir, even exercising the veto","3857":"Over time, other P5 members acted similarly at different points","3858":"A setback for India, the Security Council meeting reaffirmed the Kashmir dispute\u2019s international status","3859":"The P5 were therefore the key to ensuring that the UNSC discussed the issue after the Indian action","3860":"As Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the UN at the time, I faced one of the most challenging moments of my diplomatic career, as did the Pakistan Mission

York","3879":"Russian support was equally critical and, fortunately, they responded positively","3880":"The UK wasn\u2019t hard to convince and conveyed its support on the eve of the meeting","3881":"The only opposition to the meeting, which China persuaded us would be a closed one to garner maximum support, came from France","3882":"Prime Minister Modi\u2019s upcoming visit to Paris and a defence deal likely lay behind this","3883":"Among non-permanent members the most helpful was Kuwait","3884":"Indonesia came around once it saw consensus emerge for the meeting","3885":"New Delhi went into overdrive to stop the meeting, with top officials frantically lobbying the capitals of UNSC members","3886":"The arguments deployed by Indian diplomats in New York were familiar \u2014 and disingenuous","3887":"Its Aug 5 action was to \u2018promote Kashmir\u2019s economic development\u2019 by \u2018integrating\u2019 it with India; it was an internal, \u2018administrative\u2019 matter; UNSC resolutions were old and irrelevant","3888":"These arguments were easily refuted as they flew in the face of facts","3889":"UNSC resolutions remained alive, I

members voiced concern over violations of human rights, urged an end to the lockdown and called for peaceful resolution of the dispute based on UNSC resolutions and the Charter","3895":"The UK called for an inquiry into rights abuses while the Russian representative referred to UNSC resolutions in his public remarks","3896":"Although consultations are informal meetings of the UNSC, this was a landmark development because it (i) nullified India\u2019s claim that Kashmir was an internal matter and confirmed the international status of the dispute, (ii) reaffirmed that UNSC resolutions on Indian-occupied Kashmir remain alive and central to resolution of the dispute, and (iii) the Council\u2019s consensus for a peaceful settlement endorsed Pakistan\u2019s position that the dispute be resolved by negotiations, not unilateral coercive means","3897":"This marked Pakistan\u2019s first diplomatic response to India\u2019s illegal actions and was intended to be built upon by further

issue is \u201ca fiction maintained only by a large security presence\u201d, says a report released by the US Institute of Peace","3965":"The report by the Washington-based think tank, which is funded by the US Congress, argues that New Delhi\u2019s claim will \u201cbe sorely tested by the disaffection that has intensified\u201d among Kashmiris since Aug 5 last year when India illegally annexed the disputed territory","3966":"\u201cNew Delhi will increasingly find it hard to manage its narrative about constitutional and political changes ushering in peace to Kashmir","3967":"Most indicators of violence in Kashmir have been on the rise since the August 2019 decision,\u201d the report adds","3968":"Arguing that \u201cthis untenable situation\u201d will motivate all sides to come to the negotiating table, the report suggests a fresh look at a solution arrived at in 2004-07 by back-channel interlocutors appointed by president Pervez Musharraf and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh","3969":"The report claims that the four-point formula proposed by president Musharraf and fine-tuned during the subsequent back-channel negotiations, is the best available solution to the Kashmir conflict","3970":"Claims formula proposed by Musharraf is the best available solution to the Kashmir issueThe report then reviews all four points to see if those are still applicable","3971":"Self-gove\u00adr\u00adnance was the first point in this formula, which required both regional and territorial integrity, as was agreed in the Musharraf-Manmohan deal, and special status","3972":"The report acknowledges that India\u2019s Aug 5 decision has undone this option","3973":"But the report claims that demilitarisation of Kashmir, the second main point of the 2004-07 deal, is still possible if both India and Pakistan agree to do so","3974":"This would require India to persuade Kashmiris not to take up arms against the Indian state and Pakistan \u201cto curb militant activities along the Line of Control (LoC)\u201d","3975":"The report suggests starting with pilot programmes in some territorial pockets","3976":"If those prove successful, demilitarisation could be extended to other parts of Kashmir","3977":"But the report warns that even if Pakistan were \u201cto control militancy on its side, Kashmir might still suffer from attacks launched by indigenous militants\u201d","3978":"And widespread disaffection in Kashmir \u201ccould play the role of a spoiler for long enough to wreck plans for demilitarisation\u201d, the report adds","3979":"The report also notes that before Aug 5, 2019, some steps were already taken to implement the third element of this formula \u2014 allowing the free movement of people and trade between India, Pakistan, and the two Kashmirs","3980":"In February 2005, the two sides formally announced that a bus service would run between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; the service began in April that year","3981":"A second service, from Poonch to Rawalakot, started just over a year later, in June 2006","3982":"This dialogue process eventually led to the beginning, in October 2008, of trade across the LoC; duty-free barter trade for 21 items produced on either side of the divide was allowed","3983":"The report notes that in August 2019 India announced the illegal annexation and now \u201cany future talks based on that formula will be harder to begin\u201d","3984":"The fourth element of the Kashmir formula is the creation of mechanisms to oversee certain less sensitive sectors, such as the environment, on both sides of the LoC","3985":"\u201cLike progress toward the goal of making borders irrelevant, movement toward this objective is also possible if there is political will on both sides,\u201d the report argues","3986":"As the first step, the report suggests setting up working groups between India, Pakistan, and the two Kashmirs to manage common interests and tackle common issues such as trade, tourism, and river waters","3987":"\u201cThe third and fourth points of the formula are interrelated; progress toward one would facilitate progress toward the other,\u201d the

moment, we are there at the point of a bayonet","4184":"Till things improve, democracy and morality can wait'","4185":"\"That long wait continues to this day","4186":"This is the context to the Kashmir story and the state of unionist politics","4187":"Even after 73 long years since the Partition in 1947, the unionist politics in J&K is at the precipice of irrelevance","4188":"It is feeling the heat as never before","4189":"\"To this day, I fail to understand the need for this move (August 5, 2019), except to punish and humiliate,\" former chief minister Omar Abdullah argued in a recent newspaper article","4190":"To put it mildly, the August 5 decision was a blow to the Kashmiris' collective sense of pride","4191":"Perhaps, it was also aimed at instilling a sense of permanent psychological defeat in the hearts and minds of the people","4192":"It was a decision that has resulted in collective disempowerment and humiliation","4193":"A series of actions that followed only ended up serving further rounds of insult and any nuances that may have been disappeared into thin air when the region\u2019s five-time former chief minister Farooq Abdullah was placed under detention at his Gupkar residence in Srinagar","4194":"Among all the unionists, Abdullah was inarguably Kashmir\u2019s most powerful politician in the public imagination","4195":"Only until then, though","4196":"On August 6, 2019, he appeared from the balcony of his Gupkar residence to speak to the media in desperation","4197":"And he broke down","4198":"\"They [the ruling dispensation in New Delhi] want to murder us [Kashmiris]","4199":"My chest is ready","4200":"Fire here,\" Abdullah said in an emotional tone, alluding to his chest area with the fingers of his right hand","4201":"\"Not in my back,\" he added after a brief pause","4202":"This was the moment when it became clear that one of Kashmir\u2019s most influential political figures was not only caged, but also made aware that he was helpless","4203":"His humiliation was complete","4204":"\"My son (Omar Abdullah) is in jail","4205":"And I do not know how many more poor people will be in jail","4206":"I think this is the price we will have to pay,\" he said as tears streamed down his face, adding that the people of Kashmir had been \"stabbed\"","4207":"In Farooq Abdullah's fall was a message for the National Conference's cadre base and for other regional parties like the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by Mehbooba Mufti, the Sajad Lone-led J&K People's Conference (JKPC), the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) headed by incarcerated Sheikh Rasheed, and the celebrated bureaucrat-turned-reluctant-politician Shah Faesal's People's Movement (JKPM) etc","4208":"That message being that it was all over now","4209":"A year before the events of August 5, some in the J&K Raj Bhawan (Governor House) began to manufacture the narrative that the Kashmiri Muslim elite holding positions of power in the region was corrupt, that the unionists were dynastic in character, that the Hurriyat was corrupt and that the chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Bank was also dishonest","4210":"It was made up to be all about corruption","4211":"Satya Pal Malik, the region\u2019s then governor, would on a daily basis deliver prolonged monologues and scripted sermons on transparency and corrupt practices as if not a single Kashmiri was earning an honest living and that he was some kind of saviour of Kashmir trying to rid the region from the scourge of corruption","4212":"Then, in June 2018, the BJP walked away from the alliance that it had forged with the PDP in early 2015","4213":"And that is when the operation to disempower and neutralise the political centrality of the valley began","4214":"According to a unionist politician who understands the ground realities and the pulse of the public, Kashmiris have not given up","4215":"The politician says that Kashmiris are in a state of mourning, arguing that mourning is not to be taken as inaction","4216":"He believes that Kashmir will respond at the time of its own choosing after calculating the pros and cons of internal and external factors","4217":"Another unionist says he is yet to reconcile with the reality of the August 5 decision","4218":"\"Did it happen or was it a nightmare","4219":"\" he asks me as he remains under house arrest in Srinagar","4220":"He says he would be the one offering hope to thousands of people in his pockets of influence but remains clueless about what to do or what to say right now","4221":"\"I feel helpless and hopeless","4222":"\"On August 5 last year, former Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called New Delhi's move an act of \"aggression\" against the people of Kashmir and in a recent article said he won't contest elections of the J&K assembly if the region's special status was not restored","4223":"But the bitter reality is that three legislators from his own party did not resign, not even to register a token protest, if nothing else, against New Delhi's \"unilateral and undemocratic\" abrogation of Article 370","4224":"Former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who rejected New Delhi's move, is under house arrest and has been held at her residence in Srinagar for nearly a year now","4225":"Sajad, son of slain Hurriyat leader Abdul Gani Lone, who once referred to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a \"friend of Kashmiris\" whom he found \"down to earth\" and like his \"big brother\", wasn't spared either","4226":"Those who were detained along with him at Srinagar's Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) said that there were times in detention when \"Sajad shed tears\"","4227":"He felt dishonoured","4228":"Then there's the celebrated Kashmiri bureaucrat Shah Faesal, who before joining politics, had in an article published in January 2019 argued that \"at the root of the political problem in Kashmir is the paradox that those who represent the sentiment do not participate in the electoral process and those who participate in the electoral process do not represent the sentiment\"","4229":"He pointed out that \"the elected representatives are either a disempowered lot, a group of helpless daily-wagers with the Government of India or that the elected representatives are misrepresenting their electorate by not speaking out about the basic Kashmir issue\"","4230":"Faesal had resigned from his job as a civil servant and in March last year formally launched his party, the J&K Peoples Movement","4231":"At the time of his resignation, he had claimed that he would \"manipulate the system to his advantage\" and would be able to do so because he \"knows the system well\" and that it was time to employ a new \"political vocabulary\" in J&K\u2019s electoral politics","4232":"By that, he meant that unionists should stop lying about Kashmir's ground realities, public sentiment and people's political aspirations","4233":"After his famous interview with BBC\u2019s Hard Talk in August last year, he too was detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA)","4234":"After experiencing first-hand how the system treated him when he tried to speak as a 'free' man, Faesal, according to one of his close aides, now sees J&K's unionist politics as \"a brothel never to be revisited\"","4235":"But both Sajad and Faesal remain unpredictable","4236":"Since the Partition of the sub-continent, the unionists in Kashmir have been selling the idea of democracy and development to the people","4237":"They naively believed that solutions to all the intractable problems of the region would be reached within the ambit of the Indian Constitution","4238":"Since 1989, they have also been paying a heavy price for selling the idea of a secular and democratic India to the people","4239":"However, most of them now candidly concede that they have run out of arguments, aware that for decades they went against the tide and the sentiment on the street","4240":"An overwhelming majority in Kashmir always viewed them as Delhi's representatives in Kashmir, not Kashmir's representatives in Delhi","4241":"Now Delhi has demonised and disowned them and they are clueless about what to do next","4242":"The unionists (initially the JKNC and later PDP and Co","4243":") through scornful jocularity would often criticise the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) for chasing what they called an \"unrealistic goal\" of 'aazadi' or Kashmir's merger with Pakistan","4244":"The NC's argument was that restoring J&K's regional autonomy by turning the clock backwards to 1953 was an \"ideal solution\"","4245":"Whereas, late Mufti Sayeed-led PDP has batted for the \"self-rule\" and \"joint mechanism\" formula for Kashmir on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) since January 1949","4246":"The PDP's Kashmir formula was not very different from the four-point K-formula proposed by former president of Pakistan, General (retired) Pervez Musharaf, in 2006","4247":"The idea is said to have been originally floated by Farooq Kathwari, a Kashmiri American who founded the Kashmir Study Group","4248":"For many Pakistanis and Indians, Kashmir symbolises the conflict between their competing concepts of national identity","4249":"From the BJP\u2019s perspective, it has successfully contained the Kashmir story with an iron fist and controlled the narratives","4250":"But has it really won anything in Kashmir","4251":"Has its ideological decision factored in the external factors, such as China and Pakistan","4252":"And has it misinterpreted Kashmir's silence as surrender","4253":"The saffron party seems to be in a tearing hurry to alter ground realities in the region, raising anxieties about domicile, demography and dignity among Kashmiris","4254":"Other steps that the people see as anti-Kashmir include delimitation of assembly constituencies, notifying \"strategic areas\" for use by the army, and denying high-speed 4G internet services for a year now","4255":"After discrediting unionists, the BJP now appears to be on a mission to create a new political elite in Kashmir","4256":"The party has invested in Altaf Bukhari, a businessman-turned-politician and a former cabinet minister","4257":"Bukhari heads the newly-created Apni Party which, in simple words, is a loose congregation of stooges and turncoats","4258":"Most of its members are PDP dissenters","4259":"They have joined the bandwagon either because of coercion or out of greed","4260":"Despite these transparent tactics by the BJP, there appears to be little hope for the traditional unionists to revive themselves and win public trust","4261":"On March 13 this year, the J&K administration released Farooq Abdullah after seven months of detention","4262":"And what he said upon release is particularly telling: \"I speak before you as a free man","4263":"But this freedom is not complete","4264":"Several leaders are still under detention","4265":"It is important to release them","4266":"I will not make any political statement unless all political leaders are released from detention","4267":"\" When a politician of Farooq's calibre decides not to talk politics it is clear as day that the region's political landscape stands deeply altered","4268":"Farooq's silence also connotes that people have very little expectations from unionists to make a difference in Kashmir's political landscape","4269":"The unionists' mandate was limited to providing basic governance and that too has been snatched from them","4270":"Their politics in Kashmir was facing a credibility crisis but post-August 5, it stands demolished","4271":"The unionists are in a state of mourning and the people of Kashmir are trying to survive to tell the tale","4272":"And their attempt at surviving through is nothing short of an act of rebellion","4273":"Header image by AP shows protesters throwing stones at Indian troops in Srinagar","4274":"Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa will visit Saudi Arabia this weekend, officials said, seeking to calm diplomatic strains over Kashmir as financial support for Islamabad hangs in the balance","4275":"The two countries are traditionally close and Saudi Arabia in 2018 gave Pakistan a $3

Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,\u201d Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told local media last week","4282":"Last year, Islamabad had pulled out of a Muslim nations forum at the last minute on insistence by Riyadh, which saw the gathering as an attempt to challenge its leadership of the OIC","4283":"Qureshi\u2019s remarks have revived Riyadh\u2019s anger, one of the military officials and a government adviser said","4284":"Saudia Arabia had already made Pakistan pay back $1 billion two weeks ago, forcing it to borrow from another close ally China, and Riyadh is yet to respond to Pakistan\u2019s request to extend the oil credit facility","4285":"\u201cThe first year (of the oil credit facility) completed on 9th July 2020","4286":"Our request for an extension in the arrangement is under consideration with the Saudi side,\u201d a finance ministry official told Reuters","4287":"Saudi Arabia is also asking for another $1 billion back, officials at the finance ministry and one of the military officers said","4288":"The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment","4289":"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram

around the world, including the liberal west (the supposed hub of marriage based on love alone), have a tradition of matchmaking services, the subcontinent stubbornly clings to its own special brand of \u201crishta culture\u201d, where relationships are formed not just between individuals but entire families","4348":"Enter Sima Taparia, an elite class matchmaker based in Mumbai, who is the kind of \u201caunty \u201ceveryone knows and fears","4349":"Unfettered by any notions of political correctness, Taparia politely listens to her clientele: repeating the all too familiar mantra of \u201ctall, fair slim, good-natured \u201c and introduces them to a potential husband or wife","4350":"Her passive-aggressiveness aside, the looks of quiet judgement have made her a meme star and the series a hit","4351":"The series is another version of the reality TV genre that has made diverse shows such as Big Boss, Pakistani Idol, Pepsi Battle of the Bands, The Great British Bake Show and The Real Housewives franchise big hits","4352":"Most Pakistanis are familiar with the trolley routine where a girl brings tea for a prospective groom and his family, but that is not what happens on this show","4353":"Instead, the couples are shown bio-datas and asked to go on dates at restaurants and other public places to see if there is enough connection to take the matter further","4354":"While this may seem more open than the more chaperoned Pakistani style of matrimony, the family control and sky-high expectations are strikingly similar","4355":"One of Taparia's clients is a Houston-based lawyer named Aparna, who comes across as a perfectionist, one who needs her life partner to know that the country of Bolivia has salt flats because she is fond of travelling","4356":"Taparia spends a lot of time trying to understand Aparna\u2019s \u201cdemanding \u201cattitude with a professional face reader and a detailed astrological analysis","4357":"Meanwhile Akshay, a traditional young man from a wealthy family who wants someone just like his mother \u2014has turned down over 70 young women on the basis of their photographs alone\u2014 is not so thoroughly examined","4358":"\u201cDemanding behaviour is not healthy, whether it comes from a man or a woman, because it represents a desire to control which is not an ingredient found in strong relationships\u201c says Dr Sheeza Mohsin, a marriage counsellor and family therapist who has been watching the show","4359":"She added that the \u201cthe demanding label is sometimes put on women who are educated and economically independent because they may be less likely to tolerate emotional abuse or domestic violence","4360":"\u201cFor many, though Indian Matchmaking has \n  opened up a space for discussion and introspection, but \n  finding a spouse is too often reduced to a stark algorithm \n  of materialistic requirements","4361":"But men do not escape judgment entirely in this show either; another wealthy young bachelor is Pradhyuman, a jewellery designer from Mumbai, who has rejected even more young women, (150 plus at last count) who also faced criticism","4362":"His self-absorption and lack of connectivity with any of the women he was matched with was pretty evident","4363":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Similarly, Akshay

saw the more flexible Nadia, who despite her friendly, sweet personality and ability to like every person she was matched with was still unable to find commitment","4365":"So, despite the veneer of

seemed so elusive for these people","4369":"She explains, \u201cUnfortunately, the show focused on the part of our society where privileged people are looking to make an event out of their child\u2019s wedding","4370":"I will repeat the word wedding because the show had very little to do with marriage, which is a commitment to make a life with someone","4371":"\"Reality TV is not reality, a lot of \u201csoft scripting\u201d is involved and participants are chosen for their ability to create conflict and the dilemmas that give us an interesting viewing experience","4372":"Very

but can, like life, drag at points","4374":"From the safety of our couches, Sima Aunty and the rest of the cast can sometimes be funny, endearing and irritating by turns, and the show has gained a presence both on social media for both the issues it raises and as a fun watch for some","4375":"The stereotypes have been particularly grating for some because they crowd out any room for a wider perspective and more diverse experiences in that same rishta culture","4376":"None of the individuals displayed any growth in understanding or maturity despite their experiences and their inability to find a partner, and end up putting a subtle, almost orientalist, lens on this traditional procedure","4377":"Just as there are some who do not like the rishta culture, a more modified and flexible

are that your marriage will last","4382":"\u201d She elaborated further by saying, \u201cWomen and men who pursue higher education are possibly more connected with emotional intelligence or EQ, also the more mature they are, the more they know how to manage conflict and how long a relationship lasts correlates with the ability to manage and resolve conflict","4383":"\u201cSuperficially this might seem different to the Pakistani experience but, though we may not match horoscopes \u2014 the rest of the process seems startlingly familiar","4384":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar

a few hours relaxing so seriously","4386":"For many, though Indian Matchmaking has opened up a space for discussion and introspection, but finding a spouse is too often reduced to a stark algorithm of materialistic requirements","4387":"Most of the qualities that actually make human relationships work such as patience, kindness, generosity of spirit and the ability to resolve conflict in a reasonable manner are too often completely ignored","4388":"Given the scale of Covid-19 and the degree of uncertainty around it, public attention in Pakistan has rightly focused on how to come up with an effective policy response at the national and provincial levels","4389":"However, formulating an optimal policy is only part of the challenge; properly implementing it and making corrections as we go along is as important","4390":"Effective implementation cannot be achieved through a centralised and top-down approach by the government as it requires actions and cooperation of many groups \u2014 enforcement by agents of the state, appropriately empowered local decision-making structures exercising legitimacy, and voluntary compliance by both organisations and citizens","4391":"It is often lamented that rules and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in Pakistan rarely make it past the paper they are written on","4392":"In a recent Human Rights Commission Pakistan study of 415 people across 70 districts, over 75 per cent of respondents were not satisfied with the government\u2019s response to Covid-19","4393":"When asked why, the most common reason given was that government SOPs were not being enforced (62 per cent of the respondents stated this)","4394":"Pakistan\u2019s long-standing weakness in implementing policies and SOPs is now proving to be very costly","4395":"In the face of Covid-19, our inability to implement proven measures that are critical in protecting the economy and public health is affecting us all adversely","4396":"Let\u2019s start by considering two examples of critical Covid-19 containment measures that we have not yet been able to implement effectively despite creating SOPs","4397":"First, the close regulation of large religious gatherings in crowded spaces is essential because congregating in close proximity during prayers and sermons is known to increase the chance of one infected person spreading the virus to several others in a short period","4398":"The Tabhleegi Jamaat congregation at Raiwind, with over 250,000 people in participation, is a clear example of a super-spreader event where a handful of Covid-19 positive individuals likely infected thousands of others","4399":"Although, a 20-point SOP for the operation of mosques was issued by the federal government on April 19, just a few days later reports and photographic evidence showed gatherings of hundreds of people standing shoulder to shoulder \u2014 in clear violation of the standard operating procedures \u2014 across the country, including in the federal capital","4400":"This example highlights implementation failure at two levels, where citizens do not adhere to SOPs and where the state lacks the capacity to enforce them","4401":"Also read: The critical ingredient that remains missing from Pakistan's Covid response strategyThe second critical containment measure is the prevention of infection spread in workplaces","4402":"The most basic and essential protective measure for workplaces is that people with symptoms of Covid-19 do not come to work for at least seven days to avoid infecting other workers","4403":"The infection can spread easily in workplaces, as seen when 94 out of 216 employees in a call center in South Korea tested positive","4404":"Other important workplace measures include ensuring physical distancing protocols are followed, encouraging behaviour change, such as wearing masks and not shaking hands, adopting the ROTA1 system where only certain teams come into the office at one time and encouraging remote work where possible, among many others","4405":"Following recommendations by the National Coordination Committee on Covid-19, detailed organisational SOPs tailored to various industries were issued on April 14 by provincial governments","4406":"However, there was a lack of engagement and coordination with business owners to ensure voluntary compliance to measures that could reduce profitability","4407":"There was more emphasis on cleaning and disinfection of premises, without due attention to whether employers would be able to provide paid sick leave to infected workers who need to stay home for several days when sick","4408":"As places of work begin opening up, there is an urgent need to work out a financial protection mechanism for workers and encourage voluntary compliance of SOPs by business owners","4409":"Moving from the past to the present, with Eidul Azha around the corner, the prime minister himself has stepped in to remind the public through a Twitter message that they 'should not repeat what happened last Eid when SOPs were ignored and our hospitals were choked'","4410":"Based on the data collected by the government, there was a large increase in daily Covid-19 cases across Pakistan within two weeks (typical time period from infection to symptoms) of Eidul Fitr, which fell on May 24","4411":"This trend shows a strong link between non-compliance of SOPs during Eid and the surge in Covid-19 cases","4412":"The prime minister's Twitter message goes on to 'order strict implementation of government SOPs', but are these orders really going to work","4413":"We already know about the main barriers to implementing policies in Pakistan and around the world, and this gives us the opportunity to overcome them","4414":"First, we must realise that apart from the government\u2019s responsibility, non-state agencies (including firms, professional associations, community groups) and citizens also have a role to play in supporting implementation","4415":"Supporting the government in implementing SOPs is especially important in a crisis situation such as the one we find ourselves in","4416":"Second, it is important to consider that apart from enforcement of government rules through penalties for non-compliance, implementation of SOPs can also occur through voluntary compliance by organisations and citizens","4417":"More on this: How our government's communication on Covid-19 has done more harm than goodVoluntary compliance can work well in countries such as Pakistan where systems and resources for monitoring and for enforcing penalties by government agencies are weak","4418":"But there is a lot of work that needs to be done to convince non-state organisations and individuals to comply with SOPs voluntarily","4419":"According to a Gallup poll conducted in March 2020, 43 per cent Pakistanis had not taken any precautionary measures to protect themselves from coronavirus \u2014 the highest percentage of citizens from the 28 nations polled","4420":"In order to positively influence behaviours of Pakistani citizens, community groups and organisations, there are three essential pillars that must be put in place","4421":"The first is clear and effective communication about what needs to be done, why it needs to be done and who is responsible","4422":"By clearly communicating these expectations and identifying those responsible, there is a clear line of action that encourages active behaviour","4423":"Channels of communication used should be appropriate to reach the desired audience and can include telephone hotlines, websites, mass media and social media","4424":"Transparency is the second essential pillar, as this leads to trust","4425":"One of the greatest challenges in promoting voluntary compliance in Pakistan has been the trust deficit between the government and the citizens, which has long existed","4426":"While there is no band-aid solution to quickly fix this trust deficit overnight, becoming more transparent in its dealings may help government officials build confidence among citizens","4427":"Some proven strategies that promote transparency are highlighting the risks, costs and benefits associated with various policy responses; fiscal transparency of policy responses; and public accountability","4428":"These will help restore public trust and build legitimacy","4429":"One great example of building trust and protecting vulnerable communities has been through the largest poverty relief package announced by the federal government with a value of PKR 1","4430":"25 trillion, out of which PKR 200 million was provided to daily wage labourers and PKR 144 million was disbursed as unconditional cash assistance","4431":"However, much more transparency is needed for the federal and provincial governments to enable greater voluntary compliance","4432":"Empowering local actors, including elected local governments, is another way of leveraging local information and networks and bringing accountability closer to citizens","4433":"Read further: Rethinking Pakistan\u2019s welfare systems after Covid-19Third, understanding the incentives for implementing changes in the way individuals or organisations operate is also essential, so that key stakeholders for implementation are motivated to comply","4434":"For example, many members of the public are reluctant to get tested even when they experience severe symptoms because of the fear of being forcefully quarantined in inadequate government facilities","4435":"In this case, there is a disincentive to coming forward for testing and a perception of unequal treatment as the elite are seemingly easily able to evade rules on quarantine","4436":"In order to build trust and ensure compliance, the government thus needs to adopt and communicate sensible policies but also have compassionate and just enforcement mechanisms","4437":"Since Pakistan has moved out of the first phase of containment based mainly on state enforced lockdowns, we can enjoy more freedom, but we must accept that this freedom comes with more responsibility to cooperate and comply with protocols put in place for our safety","4438":"By taking small precautions and adopting compliance behaviours, we can collectively slow the spread of the virus and potentially also save

Turkish President Erdogan has issued a dramatic challenge: to Turkey, the Muslim Ummah, Muslim-Christian relations and the world","4676":"Hagia Sophia was and is no ordinary building","4677":"Built as the largest and the most important church in Christendom, when it was consecrated on December 27, 537 AD, Emperor Justinian exclaimed: \u201cSolomon, I have surpassed thee","4678":"\u201d in reference to the majestic temple Solomon had built in Jerusalem","4679":"For the nearly 1,000 years it was a cathedral, Hagia Sophia \u2014 Holy Wisdom in Greek \u2014 was the seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, second only to the Pope in Rome till the schism in 1054 AD, and then the head of the Orthodox Church","4680":"It is noted that its high altar was of solid gold, while over 40 kilogrammes of silver adorned the sanctuary alone","4681":"The mosaics which dotted the building were the work of masters \u2014 a marvel of art, iconography and the grandeur of the Byzantine Empire","4682":"Thus, the Hagia Sophia was no regular church, and its significance in the life of the Christian Church, as well as the Byzantine Empire, cannot be overestimated","4683":"On May 28, 1453, as Ottoman soldiers surrounded the formidable walls of Constantinople and defeat seemed imminent, the Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI, paid one last visit to the centre of Christendom in the

fate","4688":"Then, early in the morning, a small gate was mistakenly left open around the Romanus gate, and a number of Turkish soldiers came in","4689":"As a leader of the defenders was injured, a general confusion ensued, leading to more Turkish soldiers making inroads","4690":"Soon the Turkish flag was on top of a tower, and a cry rang out in the city: \u201cThe city is taken","4691":"\u201dThe Sultan had promised three days of plunder to his troops, and he remained true to his word","4692":"The Greek accounts are simply horrifying, and even Greeks who were in the employ of the Ottomans, like Kritovoulos, could not tone down the horrors","4693":"Kritovoulos noted that after the Turks entered the city: \u201cThen a great slaughter occurred of those who happened to be there\u2026and the City was reduced to slavery\u2026Others went to the robbing of churches, and others dispersed to the simple homes of the common people, stealing, robbing, plundering, killing\u2026handsome and lovely maidens of splendid and renowned families, till then unsullied by male eyes \u2014 some of these were dragged by force from their chambers and hauled off pitilessly and dishonourably\u2026\u201d Akpaazade, an Ottoman chronicler, also noted the pillage of the city, though understandably in subdued tones: \u201c[For warriors] pillages were excellent and satisfactory\u2026They took captive the inhabitants\u2026 The ghazis embraced the beautiful ladies","4694":"","4695":"","4696":"\u201d Byzantium, Second Rome, had truly fallen","4697":"In reversing the status of the Hagia Sophia, Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan has issued a challenge, not only to the secular roots of Ataturk\u2019s Turkey, but also to the Muslim Ummah, Muslim-Christian relations

was near, an angel would appear at Hagia Sophia, to fight the invaders and drive them back to the borders of Persia","4699":"But no angel appeared, and only the chants of the priests and monks sustained the thousands who had taken refuge","4700":"The historian Ducas noted: \u201c\u2026the whole huge sanctuary was full of men and women, below, above and in the surrounding halls \u2014 everywhere \u2014 an immeasurable multitude","4701":"And shutting the gate, they stood there fervently hoping for deliverance by the angel","4702":"Then \u2014 fighting all about, killing, taking prisoners \u2014 the Turks came to the church, when the first hour of the day was not yet flown","4703":"And where they found the doors shut, they battered these in with axes, without compunction","4704":"\u201d As the triple doors of the Hagia Sophia collapsed, Turkish soldiers poured in: men were killed, women and children tied down, and priests and monks who were still chanting matins were killed on the sanctuary","4705":"Thereafter, a general plunder of the Hagia Sophia took place","4706":"Sacred books, places and vessels were desecrated, precious metals and jewels taken out, and even the marble floor of the great church was dug up","4707":"A legend also grew from that day that some priests chanting the divine liturgy had been subsumed by the walls of the great church, and that they would one day return when the church would be restored to Christian worship","4708":"The Sultan, Mehmet, initially did not enter the city, allowing his troops to plunder it to their hearts\u2019 content","4709":"By about midday, he rode into the city and was immediately struck by the state it had been reduced to","4710":"Mehmet lamented: \u201cWhat a city we have given over to plunder and destruction","4711":"\u201d He then went straight to the Hagia Sophia, dismounted and went in","4712":"He walked up to the High Altar, and an Imam was brought in to give the azaan","4713":"The Sultan offered his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia","4714":"From that day onwards, the largest church in Christendom became a mosque","4715":"There was no sale, no compensation, just raw conquer","4716":"The rest, as they say, is history","4717":"The conversion of places of worship after conquest has been the norm till recent times","4718":"When Rome converted to Christianity, Roman temples were repurposed as churches, and when Spain was reconquered, several mosques were converted into churches","4719":"The famous Umayyad mosque in Cordoba, itself built on an earlier Visigoth church, was converted into a church in 1236, and has become a legend in itself","4720":"Similarly, a number of churches were converted or destroyed to make mosques as Muslim armies conquered Christian lands","4721":"One of the more famous of such conversions was the destruction of the Basilica of St John the Baptist in Damascus and the erection of the Umayyad mosque in its place by Caliph al-Walid in 706 AD","4722":"As it happens, the basilica itself was built upon an earlier Temple of Jupiter","4723":"On May 28, 1453, as Ottoman soldiers surrounded the formidable walls of Constantinople and defeat seemed imminent, the Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI, paid one last visit to the centre of Christendom in the East","4724":"When Constantinople fell to the Ottomans, several churches were converted into mosques","4725":"Many still remain as mosques throughout Istanbul and the rest of Turkey","4726":"But the conversion of the Hagia Sophia in 1453 into a mosque remains most significant","4727":"The status of Hagia Sophia as the centre of Eastern Christianity, its stature as the then largest church in the world, and its centrality to the Byzantine Empire made it into a powerful symbol","4728":"Its loss not only spelt the death knell for Eastern Christianity, it also sent a chill throughout Western Europe, where even the Pope feared an end of Christendom","4729":"For the Ottomans too, the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque was central to their regal claim","4730":"Soon several legends began to spread about the conversion, and it was even said that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) foretold the conversion of the church into a mosque","4731":"Thus, the symbolism of the Hagia Sophia, its status and control, have been strong since 537 AD","4732":"The reconversion of the Hagia Sophia by Turkish President Erdogan last month has served as a challenge on many fronts","4733":"First, it is a challenge to the Turkish state itself","4734":"Forged by the Young Turks under Mustafa Kemal \u2018Ataturk\u2019, modern Turkey wanted to build itself as a secular nation, after the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1918","4735":"Ataturk\u2019s vision was modernisation and secularisation of the Turkish state, and it was done fiercely","4736":"While the people remained very close to their religion and traditions, the state became avowedly secular, modern and, in certain key respects, Western","4737":"The decision of the Turkish cabinet in 1934 to convert the then Aya Sophia Mosque into a museum was in as much a break from the Ottoman past as it was to signal a new Turkey","4738":"Ataturk\u2019s Turkey wanted both its Byzantine and Ottoman past to exist not in opposition and conflict, but in peace and harmony","4739":"The symbolism of the 1934 act was therefore immense","4740":"The 2020 conversion of Hagia Sophia is thus a powerful break with Ataturk\u2019s Turkey","4741":"The vision of the \u2018Father of the Turks\u2019 is being rejected by Erdogan\u2019s Turkey","4742":"In reversing the status of the building, Erdogan has not only repudiated the secular roots of modern Turkey, but also its attempt to reconcile and own its Byzantine history","4743":"The coffin of Ataturk\u2019s Turkey was lowered by Erdogan in the Hagia Sophia on July 24","4744":"Hagia Sophia\u2019s conversion is also a sign by Erdogan to the Muslim world","4745":"At a time when the Muslim world is divided in many camps, Erdogan is forcefully reviving the memory of the Ottoman Empire and showcasing his leadership of the Islamic world","4746":"With both Saudi Arabia and Egypt antagonistic towards Erdogan, and many other Muslim majority states oblivious, this move will endear him with not only his own population, but also people across the Muslim world","4747":"At a time when the Muslim world is seemingly leaderless, this action \u2014 and that too in the old Caliphate capital of Constantinople \u2014 showcases Erdogan as the new Caliph who strives for Islam\u2019s \u2018victory\u2019, more than anyone else in the Muslim world","4748":"No wonder then, the Arabic note circulated by Erdogan\u2019s office after the announcement noted that, \u201cThe revival of Hagia Sophia is a greeting of peace sent out from the depths of our hearts to all of the cities which represent our culture, beginning with Bukhara, all the way to Andalusia","4749":"\u201d Hence, this move will be used to further cement his leadership in the Islamic world, and force other leaders to fall in line","4750":"Erdogan\u2019s conversion of the Hagia Sophia has also been an unimaginable blow to Muslim-Christian relations","4751":"Aside from the initial few years after the coming of Islam, Christianity and Islam have been at loggerheads","4752":"The battle between the Byzantines and the Turks was not so much a fight between two empires, but between two religious ideologies","4753":"Both called each other infidels, and both roused their troops through religion invocations","4754":"Thus, when the Byzantine Empire was defeated, Sultan Mehmet did not go to the Imperial Palace \u2014 the seat of government \u2014 or even asked about the Byzantine Emperor","4755":"His first stop was the Hagia Sophia, the seat of religion","4756":"It was conquering this edifice and converting it into a mosque which signified for Mehmet his leadership of the Muslim Ummah and the defeat of Christendom","4757":"In the West, too, there were fewer tears for the end of the Byzantine Empire and a lot more for the loss of the eastern headquarters of the Church","4758":"Despite the fraught history of Muslim-Christian relations in the past, the period since the 1960s has been markedly different","4759":"While the visit of Christian leaders to mosques, and vice versa, would lead to anathemas a century ago, today it is common practice","4760":"In a landmark reversal of the Catholic Church\u2019s view of Islam, the 1965 document Nostra Aetate of the Second Vatican Council noted: \u201cThe Church regards with esteem also the Muslims","4761":"They adore the one God, living and subsisting in Himself\u2026they take pains to submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God","4762":"\u201d This statement opened a new door for cordial relations between Christianity and Islam, relations which, despite some setbacks, have improved dramatically in the recent past","4763":"While one cannot go into more details here, suffice to note that on February 4, 2019, Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar signed a joined document on \u201cHuman Fraternity,\u201d which called upon followers of both religions to work together for peace","4764":"It noted: \u201cIn the name of God\u2026Al-Azhar al-Sharif and the Muslims of the East and West, together with the Catholic Church and the Catholics of the East and West, declare the adoption of a culture of dialogue as the path; mutual cooperation as the code of conduct; reciprocal understanding as the method and standard","4765":"\u201d It further underscored that, \u201cwe resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood","4766":"\u201d Hence, this and several other joint documents over recent years have started a new chapter in Muslim-Christian relations, where the antagonism of the past has been replaced by respect, where conflict has been replaced by cooperation","4767":"Despite the strong cordial development of Muslim-Christian relations in the recent past, Erdogan\u2019s actions hearken to another time: a time of conflict and war","4768":"In celebrating Mehmet and his conquest and conversion of the Hagia Sophia, Erdogan is rejecting the developments made in Muslim-Christian relations","4769":"No wonder then that Erdogan exclaimed: \u201cThe conquest of Istanbul and the conversion of the Hagia Sophia into a mosque are among the most glorious chapters of Turkish history","4770":"\u201d The usage of the Ottoman sword by the Imam during the sermon was a strong reminder of the mindset of the Ottomans returning and energising the fashioning of the new Turkish state","4771":"Hagia Sophia is a symbol of a millennia of Christianity, and its conversion now, after such improved relations between the two religions, is a testament that Erdogan wants to turn the clock back","4772":"Finally, by converting the Hagia Sophia, Erdogan has offered a strong challenge to the world","4773":"At a time when people and states are atoning for the sins of the past, and trying to chart a new way, Erdogan is firmly celebrating the crimes of past","4774":"Rather than pledging that never again would a place of worship of one religion be converted to another, he is eulogising the conversion","4775":"As comparison, it is like putting up a statue of a slave owner precisely for his slave owning, at a time the world is taking them down","4776":"Shunned by the European Union and struggling to shore up support in the Muslim world, Erdogan is the pall bearer of a new civilisational conception which is more dangerous, divisive and destructive than the world has seen in recent memory","4777":"The writer is a historian at ITU Lahore","4778":"He tweets @BangashYK","4779":"Email: yaqoob","4780":"bangash@gmail","4781":"comPublished in Dawn, EOS, August 9th, 2020","4782":"ISLAMABAD: In a crucial development, a government team and two groups of independent power producers (IPPs) and wind power projects (WPPs) reportedly reached an understanding on reduction in the rate of return on equity and late payment surcharge (LPS) and sharing of savings on account of plant efficiencies on Thursday","4783":"A senior government official told Dawn that about half of the 12 IPPs set up under the 2002 power policy and an association representing about two dozen WPPs had already signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with a negotiation team led by former federal secretary Babar Yaqoob Fateh Muhammad while others are expected to follow suit within 15 days","4784":"These do not include the IPPs under 1994 policy, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, public sector plants of generation companies, hydropower and nuclear power projects which claim over 75 per cent of the capacity payments","4785":"Since most of the IPPs remained unutilised for almost nine months last year and are on the last leg of their terms, the total savings would amount to about 5pc of the total energy purchases that last year stood at about Rs775 billion or about Rs35-40bn, the official explained","4786":"All projects will convert their contracts to \u2018take and pay basis\u2019The understanding followed principles from government side that power purchase agreements are sacrosanct, the IPPs would not be subjected to media trial and there would be no investigations or arm twisting","4787":"However, evidence was put on the table to suggest that on a case to case basis, investments had been exaggerated, equity overstated and machinery over-invoiced and taxes underpaid and hence mutually agreed changes in existing contractual relationship","4788":"For foreign investors registered with the State Bank of Pakistan, the return on equity (ROE) \u2018will be 12pc prospectively\u2019","4789":"For local investors, the ROE will be changed to 17pc in rupee terms without dollar indexation","4790":"\u201cIn recalculating the return, the equity approved by the National Electric and Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on commercial operation date in dollar shall be converted into rupee at an exchange rate of Rs145 for prospective calculation\u201d, according to an MoU seen by Dawn","4791":"The two sides have also agreed that any saving in fuel for oil-based projects would be shared on a sliding scale starting from 70:30 in favor the government for the first 0","4792":"5pc efficiency improvement above currently determined benchmark by Nepra, followed by 60:40 for next 0","4793":"5pc, followed by 50:50 for next 0","4794":"5pc, and finally 40:60 for any efficiency above that","4795":"The government will not share efficiency losses","4796":"Likewise, any savings in operations and maintenance (O&M) in case of these plants would be shared 50:50 after accounting for any reserves for major overhauling","4797":"If the reserve for major overhaul remains unutilised, it will be shared in the ratio of 50:50 by the IPP and the government, which will not share losses in O&M and major overhaul","4798":"For gas projects, the fuel and O&M will be taken as one consolidated line and any net savings will be shared 60:40 by the government and IPP, after accounting for any reserves for major overhaul","4799":"The unutilised reserve for overhaul would be shared on 60:40 by the government and IPP","4800":"Power purchaser will not share in fuel, O&M and major overhaul losses","4801":"The two sides have also agreed for heat rate test by the government of the IPPs to ensure actual efficiency matched reported accounts","4802":"Moreover, the LPS would be lowered both by the IPPs and WPPs from the current Kibor plus 4","4803":"5pc to Kibor plus 2pc but it will be ensured that payments follow the power purchase agreement (PPA) mandated first-in-first-out payment to make this rate effective","4804":"Compounding and interest on interest provided for in the PPA, etc","4805":"will be adjusted to match the settlement agreement initialed (but never put into effect) by the government and some of the IPPs in 2019","4806":"On \u2018miscalculation\u2019 of internal rate of return (IRR) on account of periodicity of payments, no adjustment shall be made for the past as the regulator

to government goodwill","4819":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","4820":"IT has been a year since the Indian government changed the status of Kashmir by making amendments to Articles 370 and 35A","4821":"Since then, Pakistan\u2019s efforts to highlight this unilateral change to a disputed territory and the human rights violations within it have been under the spotlight","4822":"In the past year, Islamabad has tried to draw domestic as well as international attention to India\u2019s actions, especially the human rights violations as well as its unilateral efforts to change what is seen and accepted as an international dispute","4823":"The government claims the strategy is a success","4824":"And as evidence, government officials point to the widespread, international coverage of the situation in India-held Kashmir, especially the human rights violations and the miseries faced by the valley\u2019s hapless Muslims","4825":"This coverage, especially as it includes criticism of India, is a breath of fresh air for many of us in Pakistan, used as we are to a world press routinely critical of Pakistan and enamoured of an India which is seen, in turns, as a democratic, emerging economic power and exotic","4826":"But how much of this coverage has taken place due to the efforts of the Pakistani state and how much is due to India itself","4827":"One, after all, should not deny India credit for its achievements","4828":"Discussion is needed on all IHK-related changes in order to understand and find ways to deal with them","4829":"And regardless of the answer to this question, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that such coverage, especially of Kashmir, is not new","4830":"The 1990s were not much different either when the valley saw considerable violence; there was coverage then also","4831":"But then as the unrest decreased so did the coverage","4832":"Be it international press coverage or even condemnations issued by international platforms, their ability to change the course of politics or history is limited","4833":"We would do well to remember it","4834":"At the same time, our focus on how the world is viewing Kashmir has prevented any debate on other pressing matters, among which is the rapidity with which India has put in place steps to try and change the valley\u2019s demography","4835":"This has been detailed in the recent International Crisis Group\u2019s report on Kashmir titled Kashmir: Raising the Stakes in Jammu and Kashmir","4836":"According to the report, in April this year, as the world was dealing with Covid-19, the Indian government allowed Indians from other states to seek permanent residency in Jammu and Kashmir","4837":"It says that in \u201cthe eyes of most Kashmiris, including pro-India parties, this change in legislation, and the circumstances in which it was taken, is a clear indication that the BJP government\u2019s long-term objective is to alter Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s ethnic, social and religious identity\u201d","4838":"The new rules have made eligible those who have lived in Kashmir for 15 years and their children who have studied there for seven, as well as children of central government employees who have resided there for 10 years and migrants (and their children) registered with the relief and rehabilitation commissioner","4839":"Apparently, by late July (a mere three months later), over 400,000 residency certificates had been issued","4840":"In addition, the report states that the government has removed \u201call obstacles\u201d to non-Kashmiris seeking to buy property in Kashmir","4841":"The report also pointed out that outsiders now hold a considerable number of senior bureaucratic posts as well as those at the district level","4842":"\u201c\u2026 [N]one of the lieutenant governor\u2019s top four advisers \u2014 equivalent to ministers \u2014 are Muslims","4843":"At the district level, too, only half the civilian administrative heads are Kashmiri Muslims\u201d","4844":"According to the report, \u201cKashmiris perceive the arrival of new officials at the district and subdistrict levels, especially in the revenue and land departments, as part of a design to alter land records\u201d","4845":"However, there is little discussion at home of these changes","4846":"Perhaps, it is just too difficult to acknowledge what these legal and administrative changes can and will mean not just for India-held Kashmir but for the bilateral relationship and the status of the disputed territory","4847":"But we must discuss it and understand it in order to find ways to deal with it","4848":"A second issue to be addressed head-on is the larger, international perception","4849":"The recent ICG as well as the USIP reports point to this","4850":"ICG\u2019s report acknowledges the home-grown militancy in Kashmir by writing that \u201cUnlike the 1990s, when many militants in Kashmir were foreigners, mainly Pakistanis, and local insurgents were reportedly trained across the border, the new generation of Kashmiri militants is mostly home-grown","4851":"Trained locally, they are motivated by local factors; many have never left the Valley","4852":"\u201dBut the report also speaks of Pakistan\u2019s alleged proxies","4853":"This issue has been highlighted in another report on Kashmir by the United States Institute of Peace, which also claims infiltrations are increasing","4854":"Both the reports refer to the pressure of the Financial Action Task Force on Pakistan","4855":"Of course, such reports can be easily dismissed by pointing to the bias of the author or the organisation but it may prove more helpful to ask why \u2014 despite the efforts of the state in this regard \u2014 Pakistan has not been able to convince the world at large of its efforts to turn its back on proxy groups","4856":"This is a difficult and an unpleasant question to ask","4857":"For the answers it leads to and the debate it stirs will not be particularly comfortable for it will require us to talk about our past and present, our media as well as our academia","4858":"But these questions must be asked and uncomfortable conversations had if we are to address some of the issues around the Kashmir crisis","4859":"And they will also need to be had because of the initial international reaction in the aftermath of Balakot","4860":"Silence is

his office in Karachi","5101":"Upon arrival I am ushered into a room full of cardboard boxes where Jofa (in black jeans, a navy blue shirt and a mask of his own creation on his face), is occupied with the task of stuffing PPE into them before dispatch to Civil, Indus and Shaukat Khanum hospitals","5102":"\u201cThis is the finest achievement of my life","5103":"I have never done anything like this before,\u201d he declares as he seats himself at  his desk to address my questions","5104":"According to him, the idea to make PPE popped into his head after he read an article on Bloomberg about doctors in Spain using garbage bags due to a chronic shortage of PPE","5105":"\u201cIt was alarming","5106":"\u201d he says","5107":"\u201cIf this could happen in Spain, how much worse would the situation be in Pakistan","5108":"\u201d This is when he resolved to do something about it","5109":"He made his first prototype and presented it to Dr Seemin Jamali, ED at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC)","5110":"It was unceremoniously rejected","5111":"Dr Jamali, however, guided him as to the correct SOPs to make PPE","5112":"Armed with this information, within 48 hours he was back at JPMC with a second prototype","5113":"This one met with approval and he was given the green signal to continue \u2013 and today (mid May) he has already supplied over 3,000 pieces to multiple hospitals and NGOs across Pakistan including Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Karachi, Khuzdar, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta","5114":"His target is to produce a total of 5,000 \u2013 and

different things","5118":"This may also explain why he has experimented so much \u2013 from jewellery to ice-cream, to real estate and fashion design","5119":"\u201cI never know what\u2019s next","5120":"Today I am into clothing, tomorrow I may quit and start something new from scratch","5121":"\u201d  Originally named Muhammad Asim, Jofa was born into a family of jewellers from Delhi, who migrated to Karachi after Partition","5122":"The family set up their first shop in Meethadar\u2019s Sarafa Bazaar (Pakistan\u2019s first jewellery market)","5123":"The shop was named Haji Muhammad Shafi & Sons","5124":"Jofa\u2019s father then opened a second shop in the vicinity called Fancy Jewellers and it was there that after school Jofa and his brother Muhammad Arif re-paired in order to learn the ropes of the trade","5125":"\u201cMy father used to ask us to separate emeralds or rubies according to their shade and expected us to be better at it every time","5126":"\u201dAfter graduating from Government Commerce College in 1993, Jofa and his brother opened their own jewellery store in Tariq Road","5127":"He worked there for 10 years, after which the brothers separated and he opened Gold Mark in the newly built Park Towers Clifton in 2000","5128":"Then in 2005, while still running Gold Mark he bought over the M\u00f6venpick ice-cream business in Pakistan","5129":"\u201cTheir outlet was just next to my shop and I used to eat their ice-cream every day","5130":"Then I heard they were selling the business; I asked about the selling price and eventually bought it","5131":"\u201d He has been running the M\u00f6venpick ice-cream business with a partner for 16 years now and has reportedly increased sales by 600%","5132":"Jofa opened his next boutique in The Forum in Karachi, calling it Jofa \u2013 an acronym for Jewellery of Asim","5133":"As it turned out, Nadia Mistry, his friend and fashion designer, started to call him \u2018Jofa\u2019 and the name caught on \u2013 so much so, that he adopted it as his surname","5134":"That was when Muhammad Asim became Asim Jofa","5135":"It was a new surname and a new brand","5136":"His next venture was Diamond Gallery, a two-storey jewellery boutique located next to Ocean Mall","5137":"Although the jewellery business was doing fairly well, the restless Jofa tried his hand at real estate and in 2007 he acquired a 25% share (and approximately 100 acres of land) in the Maymar Housing Scheme","5138":"\u201cBut there were too many partners and this led to frequent disputes and I quit","5139":"\u201d However, as property investment turned out to be a good experience, in 2009 he built Jofa Towers, a multi-storey office building in Gulshan-e-Iqbal","5140":"\u201cAnd then one fine day, after almost two decades of doing this, I realised I did not want to continue my jewellery business","5141":"\u201d Jofa was caught by the lawn bug, and in 2009 without further ado, he transformed his jewellery business into a clothing one","5142":"Given his lack of know-how, Jofa started by learning how to cut and sew with the help of two tailors he hired and by early 2010, he was ready to launch the Asim Jofa Luxury Lawn Collection with a tagline: \u201cI Wear Asim Jofa","5143":"\u201d He further honed his design and draping skills by attending St Martin\u2019s School of Arts in London in 2013 and later expanded his into pr\u00eat and bridals","5144":"Today Jofa launches an average of 12 collections a year which include his luxury lawn and pr\u00eat \u2013 and his success in his newly chosen field is assured","5145":"The question, however, is whether he will also tire of being a fashion designer and venture into something else","5146":"\u201cNo matter what I do, I do not feel I have accomplished anything and the satisfaction does not last","5147":"When I went into ice-cream, I thought this was it","5148":"","5149":"","5150":"and this is what I feel every time I start anything new","5151":"\u201d For the moment Jofa has his focus on manufacturing PPE","5152":"He says he has not derived as much satisfaction with anything else","5153":"This is my cue to ask why he is set on just producing 5,000 units","5154":"The demand is not just in Pakistan but worldwide and is likely to continue for some time","5155":"\u201cI don\u2019t think I will continue this in the long-term","5156":"I don\u2019t want to be answerable","5157":"Once you get into this line of work, people assume it to be their right to ask how much profit I make and where it goes","5158":"I

Lokamanya (an honorific which means 'a leader respected by the people')","5497":"\" \t\t\tIn a heartfelt tribute, Jinnah wrote: \"Mr Tilak rendered yeoman services to the country and played a very important part in bringing about the Hindu-Moslem unity, which ultimately resulted in the Lucknow Pact in 1916","5498":"\"An authentic account of Jinnah\u2019s admiration for Tilak has been penned by Mohammedali Currim Chagla, the great jurist who served as chief justice of the Bombay High Court from 1948 to 1958","5499":"As a young lawyer, Chagla worked in the chamber of Jinnah, whom he idolised","5500":"Under Jinnah\u2019s influence, he became a member of the Muslim League but quit the party after it started espousing the cause of Pakistan as a separate Muslim nation","5501":"Tilak was his childhood hero","5502":"This is what Chagla wrote in his autobiography Roses in December: \u201cDuring my long association with Jinnah, I found that he always showed the greatest respect and regard for Tilak","5503":"Two persons in public life for whom Jinnah showed the greatest respect were [Gopal Krishna] Gokhale and Tilak","5504":"\u2026 [T]he regard Jinnah had for Tilak was reciprocated by Tilak","5505":"\"Tilak was born on July 23, 1856 in the coastal town of Ratnagiri in the Konkan region of Maharashtra","5506":"Konkan, incidentally, had close contacts with Karachi in pre-Partition times","5507":"He studied in Pune, where he co-founded Fergusson College, one of India's most prestigious educational institutions","5508":"He became a renowned scholar in law, mathematics and Sanskrit","5509":"Later in his life, he wrote one of the most admired treatises on the Hindu scripture, Bhagavad Gita, extolling Karma Yoga or the philosophy of action for a noble cause","5510":"However, his passion was politics","5511":"To popularise his mission for India\u2019s complete independence from British rule, he established two newspapers, Kesari (in Marathi, the native language of Maharashtra) and Mahratta (in English), which soon earned him the ire of the colonial administration","5512":"The second half of the 19th century was an extremely difficult period in the freedom struggle","5513":"The defeat suffered by the uprising in 1857, and the bloody reprisals unleashed in its aftermath by the British, had created utter disillusionment that continued for many decades","5514":"The founding of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, and of the All India Muslim League in Dhaka in 1906, were natural responses of a freedom-loving nation that was trying to find its political voice","5515":"However, the voice was still weak and subdued","5516":"This is when Tilak began to quicken the growth of nationalist consciousness","5517":"Nehru, who was then a student in England, writes in his autobiography: \"From 1907 onwards for several years India was seething with unrest and trouble","5518":"For the first time, since the Revolt of 1857, India was showing fight and not submitting tamely to foreign rule","5519":"","5520":"","5521":"Almost all of us were Tilakites or Extremists, as the new party was called in India\"","5522":"Historians credit Gandhi with transforming the Congress into a mass movement","5523":"No doubt, he did so on a nationwide scale","5524":"But none can deny that Gandhi followed up, and greatly expanded, on the mass-oriented political work that Tilak had begun","5525":"Tilak's two arrests by the British on charges of sedition \u2014 first in 1897, when he was jailed for 18 months, and, especially, later in 1908, when he was sent to Mandalay in Burma for six years of rigorous imprisonment \u2014 galvanised the nation in an unprecedented manner (Jinnah successfully defended Tilak in the latter\u2019s third sedition trial in 1916)","5526":"Tilak\u2019s banishment to Burma provoked the first ever political strike by the working class; the textile workers of Bombay (Hindus of all castes as well as Muslims) struck work for six days, one day for every year of the sentence","5527":"Roaring like a lion in the Bombay High Court, Tilak asserted, \"Swaraj is my birth right, and I shall have it\"","5528":"When the judge asked him if he had anything to say before the sentence was pronounced, he audaciously replied: \"All I wish to say is that in spite of the verdict of the jury, I maintain my innocence","5529":"There are higher powers that rule the destiny of men and nations","5530":"It may be the will of providence that the cause I represent may prosper by suffering than by remaining free","5531":"\" These inspiring words were subsequently etched in a marble plaque in court room no","5532":"46 in Bombay High Court, where he was tried","5533":"Condemning Tilak\u2019s imprisonment, Vladimir Lenin, who would lead the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917, wrote, \"The infamous sentence pronounced by the British jackals on the Indian democrat Tilak\u2026this revenge against a democrat by the lackeys of the money-bags evoked street demonstrations and a strike in Bombay","5534":"In India, too, the proletariat has already developed to conscious political mass struggle \u2014 and, that being the case, the Russian-style British regime in India is doomed","5535":"\"Among Tilak's countless admirers was Maulana Hasrat Mohani, an eminent freedom fighter and Urdu poet, who coined the slogan Inquilab Zindabad (\"long live the revolution\")","5536":"After Tilak\u2019s imprisonment in 1908, he wrote a ghazal in praise of Lokamanya","5537":"Here are a few lines from it translated in English","5538":"O Tilak, o pride of patriotism\n   \n  The knower, the follower, the believer and articulator of righteousness \n   \n  The foundation of openly expressed freedom rests on you \n   \n  The assembly of sincerity and loyalty is illuminated by you \n   \n  You were the fiesta to hear O Son of India\n   \n  Imprisonment in the service of India \n   \n  Your being became the beacon light of freedom \n   \n  Otherwise our friends were shackled in slavery \n   \n  You have cast such a spell of self-respect \n   \n  With one stroke, it cancelled all rituals of flattery \n   \n  The free Hasrat prides himself on following you \n   \n  May the Great God keep you for long","5539":"In his book Jinnah and Tilak \u2014 Comrades in the Freedom Struggle, prolific scholar A G Noorani quotes Kanji Dwarkadas, a close Hindu friend of Jinnah in Bombay: \"The two great political centres in Bombay at that time were Sardar Grih (a modest guest house in which Tilak lived in a single room) and Jinnah's chambers in the High Court","5540":"All political roads led to these two places for organisation, consultation and decision","5541":"\"  Sardar Grih was in close vicinity of Anjuman-i-Islam, the oldest Muslim educational institution in India founded in 1874, a year before the establishment of the Aligarh Muslim University by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan","5542":"Its founder was Badruddin Tyabji (1844-1906), a great patriot who was president of the Indian National Congress at its third session in Madras (1897)","5543":"As a judge of the Bombay High Court, he was known for his courage and impartiality, as became clear in his granting bail to Tilak in a sedition case in 1897 after it had been rejected thrice by others","5544":"Tyabji, unlike Sir Syed, urged Muslims to join the Congress so that the interests of Muslims and Hindus could be advanced jointly","5545":"Incidentally, Jinnah, who held the same view, regarded Tyabji as his mentor, and once told him that there was \"nothing that I shall follow more readily than your advice\"","5546":"All great historical personalities have been victims of falsification of history in some way or the other","5547":"This is also true about Tilak, who has been accused by some of being a \"Hindu nationalist\" and, therefore, \"anti-Muslim\"","5548":"In support of this criticism, it is cited that he introduced \"Hindu revivalism\" into the national movement by popularising the festivals associated with Ganesh (a Hindu deity) and Shivaji (a Maratha warrior-king)","5549":"The fact is he did so to mobilise the people in the freedom movement and what his critics conveniently ignore is that he also participated in Muharram processions with his Muslim compatriots in Pune, just as many Muslims took part in Ganesh and Shivaji festivities","5550":"It is true that in his earlier writings, Tilak flayed what he regarded as the fanaticism of Muslim invaders","5551":"But Tilak\u2019s views on Indian Muslims changed in the course of the freedom struggle, and he became convinced that unity between Hindu and Muslim communities was absolutely necessary for India's liberation and future progress","5552":"He affirmed that Indian nationalism is \"composite\" \u2014 meaning that it has equal place for Hindus and Muslims","5553":"Tilak wrote in Kesari: \"When Hindus and Muslims jointly ask for Swarajya from a common platform, the British bureaucracy has to realise that its days are numbered","5554":"\" Here is some proof that Muslims of the time saw him as an Indian nationalist and not as a Hindu nationalist","5555":"When the British government arrested and imprisoned Tilak in a sedition case in 1897, his friends in Calcutta collected 16,000 rupees for his defence","5556":"Out of this, 7,000 rupees were donated by a Muslim-owned business firm Hirjee Ahmaed & Hajee Hossain Hajee Abdel","5557":"What Hajee Abdel wrote in the donation's covering letter is revealing","5558":"\"The moment the Government arrested him, Mr Tilak ceased to be a leader of the Hindu community","5559":"He is now above all castes, creeds, and religions","5560":"He is going to be prosecuted for his fight for India, the common motherland of the Muslims and Hindus","5561":"\" Both Shaukat Ali and his brother Mohammed Ali Jauhar held Tilak in high esteem because of his bold support to Muslim concerns, including his sympathy for their anti-imperialist Khilafat cause","5562":"Shaukat Ali even said: \"I would like to mention again for the hundredth time that both Mohammed Ali and myself belonged to, and still belong to, Lokamanya Tilak\u2019s political party","5563":"\" Furthermore, the mother of Ali brothers, Abadi Bano Begum, popularly known as 'Bi Amma', was also a Tilak supporter","5564":"She addressed meetings urging people to donate to the Tilak Swaraj Fund, which Gandhi had created in Tilak\u2019s memory","5565":"Those were truly sunny days for Hindu-Muslim fraternity","5566":"Recall this \u2014 when, some days after his cremation in Bombay, Tilak\u2019s ashes were brought to his native city Pune by a special train, the procession stopped near a mosque and the people honoured their beloved leader with the slogan \"Hindu-Muslim ekta ki jai\"","5567":"Similar views on the need for Hindu-Muslim solidarity for national liberation were held by Jinnah, who was the most promising young lawyer and nationalist Muslim politician in India in the first two decades of the last century","5568":"Remarkably, he was an active member, simultaneously, of both the Congress and the Muslim League","5569":"He had joined the Congress in 1896, when he returned from England to Bombay to start his law practice","5570":"In 1906, he attended the Calcutta session as secretary to Dadabhai Naoroji, the 'Grand Old Man' of India\u2019s freedom struggle, who was then president of Congress","5571":"He would take membership of the Muslim League much later, in 1913","5572":"Jinnah viewed himself as a bridge between the two Indian parties pursuing the common goal of national independence","5573":"Gokhale, his mentor and a leader of the 'moderate' faction of Congress (Tilak was a leader of the 'militant' wing of Congress), had described Jinnah as \"an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity\"","5574":"Jinnah himself had expressed the desire to become \"the Muslim Gokhale\"","5575":"Predictably, this confluence of views brought the leaders of India\u2019s two main political streams into a close association, whose historic outcome was the Lucknow Pact in December 1916","5576":"More by design than by coincidence, the annual sessions of the Congress and the Muslim League took place around the same time in the city that was one of the nerve centres of the 1857 War of Independence","5577":"Here, the two parties agreed on separate representation for Muslims and gave due weightage to their representation, higher than their percentage in population would warrant, in the imperial\/provincial legislatures where they were in a minority","5578":"Applying the same principle, the pact also increased the representation of non-Muslims and suitably reduced the representation of Muslims in the Muslim-majority provinces, like Punjab and Bengal","5579":"It conceded to the Muslims one-third of the seats in the Imperial Legislative Council","5580":"Furthermore, it introduced another safeguard to reassure both communities","5581":"No proposal that affected any one community could be passed in legislatures if three-fourths of that community\u2019s representatives were opposed to it","5582":"Influential Hindu leaders of the Congress, such as Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, B S Moonje and Tej Bahadur Sapru, opposed Tilak, saying he had surrendered to the Muslims by conceding the 'anti-national and anti-democratic' system of separate electorates","5583":"Yet, Tilak stood his ground and staked his all for the Hindu-Muslim settlement","5584":"Addressing over 2,000 delegates in the open session, and using words that only a leader with enormous conviction and self-confidence can, Tilak said: \"It has been said that we, Hindus, have yielded too much","5585":"The concession that has been made to our Muhammadan brethren in the Legislative Council is really nothing too much","5586":"In proportion to the concession that had been made to the Moslems, their enthusiasm and warm-hearted support is surely greater","5587":"I urge the audience to give effect actively to the resolution adopted by the Congress","5588":"\"Explaining his stand further, Tilak remarked: \"As a Hindu I have no objection to making this concession","5589":"We cannot rise from our present intolerable condition without the aid of the Muslims","5590":"\" Tilak\u2019s stand was that the \"triangular\" fight among Hindus, Muslims and the British should be reduced to a \"two-way\" fight between the British and the common front of Hindus and Muslims","5591":"And for bringing about this fundamental change, he was prepared to show that Hindus were willing to be magnanimous towards their Muslim brethren, who, after all, were fellow Indians","5592":"Jinnah echoed Tilak\u2019s thoughts and sentiments","5593":"In his speech at the Muslim League session in Lucknow, he described himself as \"a staunch Congressman\" who had \"no love for sectarian cries\"","5594":"In November 1917, addressing a public meeting in Bombay\u2019s Shantaram Chawl in Tilak\u2019s presence, he said: \"My message to the Musalmans is to join hands with your Hindu brethren","5595":"My message to the Hindus is to lift your backward brother up","5596":"\" Jinnah strongly believed in the idea of a \"union of the two great communities in India\"","5597":"He regarded it a necessity for the Hindus and Muslims \"to combine in one harmonious union for the common good\"","5598":"It is one of the great tragedies of India\u2019s freedom movement that the spirit of Hindu-Muslim unity, and Congress-Muslim League cooperation, did not last the test of subsequent developments","5599":"One reason for this is that Tilak did not live long enough to give a practical shape to its contents","5600":"Jinnah on the other hand was finding himself sidelined in the Congress party","5601":"His hopes of Hindu leaders in the Congress willing to share power with Muslims and the Muslim League in a self-governing India started fading","5602":"And they received a body blow when Nehru, who was then the Congress president, refused to share power with the Muslim League after the Congress swept the elections to the provincial legislature in UP in 1937","5603":"Thereafter, there was little trust left between the two parties","5604":"And the growing mistrust, and little cooperation, between the two ultimately led to the Partition in 1947","5605":"This happened because Tilak\u2019s prescient endeavor to transform the \"triangular\" fight \u2014 Hindu vs","5606":"British, Muslim vs","5607":"British and Hindu vs","5608":"Muslim \u2014 into a direct two-way fight between a Hindu-Muslim joint front against the British, which he had accomplished in Lucknow in 1916, came unstuck after his demise","5609":"The fight once again became \"triangular\" with cataclysmic consequences","5610":"The Lucknow Pact is now a part of history, forgotten in both India and Pakistan","5611":"But the question is: does the spirit of the pact still have any relevance","5612":"The answer, most certainly, is, yes it does","5613":"The specific provisions of the pact are no longer relevant","5614":"But its basic motivational principle \u2014 namely, that the two main communities of India should not only peacefully and cooperatively coexist but also show the readiness to compromise should the need arise \u2014 is valid even today","5615":"Both Tilak and Jinnah, if they were alive today, would have been deeply distressed at the current state of India-Pakistan relations and also at the inter-religious disharmony in our two countries","5616":"In particular, neither India nor Pakistan is showing any magnanimity, any constructive understanding, and any inclination to compromise in dealing with contentious bilateral issues","5617":"Let us be honest: can the dispute over Kashmir ever be resolved through bilateral negotiations without mutual trust, without an attitude of give-and-take, and without a commitment to justice and fairness","5618":"Are India and Pakistan to regard each other as permanent enemies","5619":"Another question to ponder is has Indian nationalism ceased to be \"composite\", as Tilak had believed it to be, after Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014","5620":"Is the concept of, and demand for, India as a 'Hindu Rashtra' consistent with Tilak\u2019s vision of India","5621":"If we ponder over these questions, we will begin to realise that the essential spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation demonstrated by Tilak and Jinnah alone can help in the fruition of two all-important challenges before us today: Hindu-Muslim harmonisation and India-Pakistan normalisation","5622":"ON this Independence Day, the nation has every reason to derive a degree of satisfaction from the knowledge that its fight against the coronavirus has been a successful one so far","5623":"What contributed greatly to the effort was that the government and opposition, though bitter foes, understood at some point that developing a national narrative to counter the infection was crucial to the fight against the virus which has devastated societies and economies the world over","5624":"This example just goes to show that a spirit of cooperation and unity can be invoked and greatly help both sides overcome a variety of challenges that have only grown since the time of independence","5625":"Indeed, there have been many opportunities to jointly work towards ending the economic downturn, illiteracy, poverty, human rights abuses and galloping population numbers that face us today","5626":"But many such chances have been frittered away in blame games and thoughtless moves to undermine each other","5627":"Among the several major challenges before us is the dangerous drift towards pernicious and retrogressive ideas that run counter to Mohammad Ali Jinnah\u2019s ideals and that could in the long run pose a threat to Pakistan\u2019s fragile democratic structure","5628":"The evolution of these anachronistic ideas is a subject unto itself, and even though they took birth in the aftermath of the Quaid-i-Azam\u2019s death, they gained momentum after 9\/11 and the subsequent rise of international terrorism","5629":"Few countries have suffered greater ravages than Pakistan as home-grown terrorists received \u2018ideological\u2019 \u2014 and in some cases material \u2014 support from right-wing elements with their own agendas","5630":"More regretfully, governments and state institutions often patronised extremist groups, parties and militants when the authorities mistakenly believed they could be of use in advancing our foreign policy objectives","5631":"While the Pakistani Taliban rejoiced at the murder of our soldiers and civilians, successive governments followed a policy of appeasement and let extremist groups operate with impunity","5632":"This misplaced leniency showed itself in tragedy both at home and abroad","5633":"Moreover, madressah products and the vast amount of literature they produced promoted regressive theocratic ideals and encouraged those out to destroy \u2018Western\u2019 values \u2014 an omnibus term for repudiating all that the founder of Pakistan stood for","5634":"Jinnah had made it clear, and not just in the Aug 11 speech, that Pakistan would not be a theocracy and that all its citizens would enjoy equal rights","5635":"Often, in state policies, there appears to be more emphasis on form and less on substance","5636":"Notice the morally hollowed Tahaffuz-i-Bunyad-i-Islam bill passed by the Punjab Assembly","5637":"Such hurriedly passed laws serve to reinforce bigotry and parochialism","5638":"Also of concern is the threat to media freedom from both state and non-state actors","5639":"What is missing is an official and nationwide rejection, loud and clear, of all ideas that run counter to the values Jinnah worked for all his life","5640":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","5641":"WELLINGTON: New Zealand said on Saturday it could have probably hosted the

wife that we have to live to seek justice for our late daughter","5662":"\u201d Subsequently, the police arrested 19 people on suspicion of the rape and murder, and charged them after a year","5663":"The tragedy was strong enough to find a place in the headlines for a night","5664":"Politicians of the area visited Rehman and promised support, while popular TV morning shows invited

court, against the nominated wedding hall owners and their waitering staff","5666":"When lawyers refused to take the case because of Faiz\u2019s financial constraints, the bereaved father appeared before the court without a legal counsel","5667":"When approached for settlement, he refused","5668":"\u201cThe promise on my daughter\u2019s grave was strong enough so that no amount on the table

Rehman\u2019s case is not an exception","5687":"Gender-based violence or sex crimes against children are not a rarity \u2014 in fact their occurrence is so frequent that a study by the NGO Sahil reports that, only in 2019, at least 2,846 cases of child sexual abuse were reported in the media","5688":"That means at least eight children are abused every day in the country","5689":"The said number was crunched based on the news reports of as many as 84 national and regional newspaper reports on child sexual abuse \u2014 leaving a huge possibility that the number is inaccurately low","5690":"Age-wise information shows that children are most vulnerable to abuse in the 6-15 years age group","5691":"More boys than girl victims were reported","5692":"The major crime categories of the reported cases in the year 2019 were 778 abductions, 405 missing children, 348 sodomy cases, 279 rape cases, 210 attempted rapes, 205 gang sodomy cases and 115 gang rapes","5693":"Sidra Humayun,

rich and powerful preparators","5696":"The sad part is no one is taking the bull by its horns","5697":"\u201dThe high-profile Zainab murder and rape case in Kasur in 2018 appeared to have broken the inertia, as it attracted the much-needed attention of policymakers on the often ignored issue","5698":"Two years after the horrific incident, the National Assembly and Senate passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Agency Bill in March 2020, under which offenders now will be sentenced to at least 10 years behind bars, and up to a maximum of life imprisonment","5699":"Additionally, the government is now mandated to set up a helpline and the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Agency, which will issue alerts on missing children and maintain an online database","5700":"To counter the

parents, while special courts will ensure a trial is completed within three months","5701":"However, the law specifically focuses on missing children; the legislation has nothing to offer for the rising number of raped and murdered child victims","5702":"Nonetheless, Karachi-based lawyer Wasim Raza Naqvi believes that the legislation is a step in the right direction, adding that at least the state is now recognising the elephant in the room","5703":"But he immediately adds that the buck stops at the implementation of the law","5704":"\u201cIt looks good on paper but we have to remember that, before this bill, all provinces had their child protection authorities which were passed after desk-thumping approval from the assemblies but, as expected, the fancy-worded commissions had virtually no impact,\u201d says Naqvi","5705":"\u201cThe Pakistan Penal Code on child abuse was also amended in 2017 to tighten laws on child abuse, sadly to no effect on ground","5706":"\u201d

which weakens the case, and obviously things go south if the evidences are not collected and secured in early stages,\u201d she laments","5709":"\u201cThe forensic teams are responsible for collecting circumstantial evidences immediately, and that requires expertise, but as our law enforcement treats gender crimes as any other crime","5710":"In the end, courts are bound to release the suspects","5711":"\u201d  The activist also appreciates the Zainab Alert bill, which has now turned into law after its approval from the parliament","5712":"however, she maintains that there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, as the terms of reference and the required financial budget are yet to be finalised","5713":"SP Shahla Qureshi, a police official who also heads a human rights desk of the department in Karachi, admits that police urgently require strict gender training to better deal with the gender-based violence cases","5714":"\u201cEvidence is the key to resolve rape and

with me","5723":"\u201dThe writer is a journalist interested in human rights and tweets @ebadahmedPublished in Dawn, EOS, August 9th, 2020","5724":" In this year of our Common Era, it has been exactly 1000 years since the death of the redoubtable Firdowsi","5725":"Indeed, one can declare him to be the world\u2019s greatest epic poet, for his monumental Shahnama [Book of Kings] is the longest epic known to us, with some 60,000 units (shers) consisting of two half-verses \u2014 that is, 120,000 single lines (misras), all in the same metre","5726":"This means that, in its volume, this Persian epic outnumbers even Jalaluddin Rumi\u2019s Masnavi by far","5727":"The Shahnama is, in many ways, intriguingly unique in world culture","5728":"Not only does it carry poetic valence, and this is obvious, it also opens up for us a vista overlooking much dynastic politics in the medieval Persianate regions of what are now Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asian territories","5729":"Through the external vicissitudes of the Shahnama, we are able to see the Samanid-Ghaznavid dynastic court drama that was often played out at the banks of the river Oxus and beyond \u2014 Transoxiana (Mawara un nahr), that is, a world that still lives nostalgically in our romantic reminiscences, not least because it was Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib\u2019s proud ancestral home","5730":"Firdowsi\u2019s relationship with Sultan Mahmud Ghaznvani, the 11th century capturer of Lahore, moves like a sinusoidal wave","5731":"At a high point, the relationship was feverish, passionate and glowing, leading to eloquent and hyperbolic praises by the poet","5732":"But at a low ebb, it rendered the Shahnama verses sarcastic, disparaging and contemptuous, casting oblique aspersions on the Sultan \u2014 as in the epic\u2019s fabricated story of a letter written by the great warrior Rustam, predicting lowly incompetent future rulers","5733":"Legend has it that, in 1020, a millennium ago, the Ghaznavid ruler, regretting that the poet had been wronged, sent to his house in Tus a caravan carrying a gift of 60,000 gold pieces","5734":"But just as the caravan was entering the gate of the city, a funeral procession was emerging from it \u2014 ah, it was the bier of none other than Firdowsi that the procession was carrying","5735":"Too late, the poet was dead","5736":"Let\u2019s also recall here the half-truth that he was laid to rest in his own garden only because a bigoted religious leader had forbidden the burial of a Shiite in the Tus cemetery","5737":"How interesting, it is a text that begets aesthetic expressions in the sphere of visual creativity","5738":"Today, the several hundred illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnama are a jealously guarded treasure of the world\u2019s cultural legacy","5739":"But the highs and lows of Firdowsi\u2019s court fortunes continue until our own times","5740":"His tomb in Tus in the Mashhad region fell into decay after years of neglect, but then it was lavishly rebuilt during 1928-34 by the orders of Reza Shah, the modern Irani ruler who instituted, in 1934, the \u201cFirdowsi Millennial Celebration\u201d with a large outlay of funds","5741":"On the other hand, leaders of the Irani Revolution have wavered in their ambivalence towards the poet, explicitly condemning him here, bringing him into the Islamic fold there","5742":"But he remains Iran\u2019s national hero nonetheless","5743":"And yet, things are way more complex, and hence way more interesting","5744":"In addition to the dual poetic and political valence of Firdowsi, there is another binary here: the text and image binary","5745":"The creator of Shahnama is as much a figure in the history of poetry as he is in the history of visual arts","5746":"Indeed, one of the leading art historians of our era, Oleg Grabar, tells us that the epic is the most frequently illustrated text in Persian arts","5747":"In the rich history of Persian painting, we are told, the great 14th century Mongol Shahnama and the \u201cextraordinary\u201d Shahnama of the Safavid Shah Tahmasp of the mid 16th century, \u201care towering masterpieces\u201d of miniature work","5748":"One ought to note that these paintings have ushered in whole research projects in the field, projects that continue even to this day","5749":"These illustrations are superb paradigms of art, standing tall","5750":"But the text has also inspired depiction of its battle scenes on ceramics and, in all likelihood, engendered murals too","5751":"With precious calligraphy rendering the verses into visual luxuriance, the abundance of colours, the vignettes and portraitures, the graphic balance, the proportion and the organic wholeness of illustrations \u2014 all of these features, in fact, have become the very defining features of high visual arts of the Persianate domains","5752":"How interesting, it is a text that begets aesthetic expressions in the sphere of visual creativity","5753":"Today, the several hundred illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnama are a jealously guarded treasure of the world\u2019s cultural legacy","5754":"Yes, this monumental work of Firdowsi has been studied both as word and as image","5755":"But there is more","5756":"In the horizontal stretch of the Shahnama, one edge marks the boundaries of ancient Persian mythology, the other is anchored in history","5757":"So we go on an excursion from pre-history to the 7th century when the Sassanids were defeated by the Muslim-Arab onslaught","5758":"Adorning the epic in-between are glittering words of wisdom, storytelling, fabricated or semi-fabricated accounts of heroic deeds and tributes to nature","5759":"The sun rises every day, but every day the sun is different \u2014 this is the epic\u2019s refrain of the perpetual renewal of the world","5760":"The crown prince of ancient Iran, Afrisiab; the ruler of Turan, Isfandyar; the young warrior Sohrab\u2019s mother Tahmina, and his valorous father Rustam\u2019s mother Rudaba; the mythic bird Simurgh, often equated to the phoenix as well as to the ambassador of good tidings, huma; Rustam\u2019s fateful horse Rakhsh; the kingdom of Samangan \u2014 all these relics of Persian mythology and legend were recovered by Firdowsi","5761":"He also prepared for us a record of Zoroastrian folklore, drawing much from Avestan sources","5762":"Then, among other things, he immortalised the Rustam-Sohrab mythic tragedy","5763":"We note that this Rustam-Sohrab tragic tale has much theatrical possibilities \u2014 the outstanding Urdu dramatist Agha Hashr Kashmiri knew this, and so did Bollywood","5764":"The columnist is Dean of the Institute of Liberal Arts, University of Management and Technology, and chairs the

closest source we have for a lost recipe","5774":"Nano stopped making kachay gosht ki biryani a long time ago","5775":"For decades, it remained suspended in memory and acquired a legendary status","5776":"Wah","5777":"They would say swaying with their hands to their chest, aisi biryani hoti thi ke hum kya bataein","5778":"But none of the khalas have ever tried making it themselves","5779":"Perhaps they thought this was a memory best left ornamental, that being tainted by reality would be too big a loss","5780":"Or perhaps they felt it was too towering a challenge, that as the legend around it grew it became impossible to match","5781":"Regardless, I\u2019ve recruited mama to my cause and together we\u2019re working to retrieve it from the past where it\u2019s stuck","5782":"Mama opens the Whatsapp chat for Mona khala and sends a cautious 'hello'","5783":"We wait","5784":"I look at my plate: five plump hari mirchain slathered in a heap of golden brown masala sitting on top of plain white rice","5785":"A large glass of chilled water is on standby near me, ready to put out inevitable fires","5786":"It is the fear of this threat from mirchain that elicits widened eyes and confused looks from guests whenever we serve mirchon ka salan at dawats","5787":"\u201cWe can eat the hari mirch","5788":"\u201dThey are right to fear hari mirchain","5789":"They were never meant to be eaten","5790":"Capsaicin, the chemical compound responsible for the mirch\u2019s spiciness, acts on heat (and not gustatory) receptors in the mouth","5791":"Spiciness is not a taste but an infliction of pain, a defence mechanism meant to protect the plant from being eaten by the wrong animal","5792":"Those that felt the pain would be deterred, or so the wisdom may have been","5793":"The human love for chillies says otherwise","5794":"We are simultaneously stung and captivated by them","5795":"This apparent contradiction is resolved by the partial neutralization of chillies in our cooking; they are sliced, chopped, mashed, crushed, or simply put in proximity to food to have their spiciness extracted but cordoned off","5796":"Unlike this peripheral role, in mirchon ka salan they are not around the food","5797":"They are the food","5798":"Seemingly fixed culinary rules that would presume to dictate what a mirch can and can not be (inedible accessory\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, main dish\u200a\u2014\u200ano) evaporate away with the steam and sizzle of the meal","5799":"The mirchain become edible as they distribute the spiciness concentrated in them to the masala all around","5800":"The confinement of the cutting and chopping is answered with complete expansion","5801":"This distribution in space becomes a distribution in time and slowly builds up in the mouth in an audaciously spicy crescendo","5802":"As we rise to meet the challenge mirchon ka salan presents, in the span of a few bites curiosity gives way to surprise, then enjoyment","5803":"We are deepened by the experience, by what it says about the necessary abrasiveness of survival","5804":"Metamorphosis of the thing cooked and its eater has been at the root of cooking since we first put food to fire","5805":"It is widely theorized that the emergence of cooked food was pivotal in shaping human evolution: more energy released from food

gathered mild interest in Europe but in India, they were well received because their flavour profile matched perfectly (and even surpassed) the existing spiciness of the cuisine","5866":"They could be

Dawn, August 12th, 2020","6049":"In the Spring of 2019, wanting to expand both my students\u2019 and my own understanding of what the genres of science fiction and fantasy had to offer us in thinking about and making sense of our world, I developed and taught an undergraduate literature course titled \"Postcolonial Science Fiction and Fantasy\"","6050":"At one point in this course, my students and I discussed one of the most enduring and popular tropes of science fiction: time travel","6051":"Time travel narratives, where the protagonist either travels back to the past or forward into the future, with the aid of either technology or magic, are ubiquitous in mainstream sci-fi","6052":"And for good reason \u2014 there is something delightful and fun about time travel narratives","6053":"A childhood favourite of mine is Back to the Future, the 1980s\u2019 blockbuster film which follows the teenaged protagonist, Marty McFly, and his scientist friend as they travel back in time to engineer the coming together of his parents so that he can ensure his own existence","6054":"But in class that day, we were about to discuss another text \u2014 one less often included in the time travel canon but which is, arguably, one of the best examples of the subgenre","6055":"In the text, the protagonist, Dana Franklin, also travels back to the past and has to work to ensure the circumstances that will lead to her own existence","6056":"The difference is that instead of a white young man traveling back to 1950s suburban America, the protagonist is a black woman who travels back to a slave plantation in a pre-Civil War America, where she meets her ancestors \u2014 an enslaved woman and the white slaveholder who will eventually rape and impregnate her","6057":"The 1979 novel Kindred by Black sci-fi writer Octavia Butler, combines sci-fi with the genre of slave narratives, using the time travel trope to imagine and interrogate a violent and difficult part of American history","6058":"My students and I marvelled at how the time travel narrative changes completely when instead of a white perspective, a Black worldview and subjectivity is centred in a story; how the stakes and challenges of traveling back in time entirely transform when the character doing it occupies a Black, female body","6059":"For instance, unlike Marty McFly, whose biggest time-traveling challenges are escaping run-ins with the local teen bullies or fending off flirtations from the woman who will become his mother, Dana has to contend with being mistaken for a runaway slave and in fact faces the threat of physical violence and rape as soon as she travels back in time to 1815","6060":"Kindred, and the many other novels and short stories written by Octavia Butler are part of a rich literary tradition within the larger umbrella of sci-fi and fantasy known as Afrofuturism \u2014 speculative fiction that imagines possible futures through a black cultural lens, that combines elements of science fiction, historical fiction, speculative fiction, fantasy and horror with Black and African belief systems and mythologies","6061":"More on this: What South Asian sci-fi can tell us about our worldBefore we turned our attention to Kindred and Afrofuturism, we had been discussing the ways in which the genre of science fiction has historically been intertwined with the ideology of imperialism and colonialism","6062":"After all, the two biggest myths in sci-fi and fantasy are that of the \"Stranger\" (the aliens on a distant planet or the savages on the far corner of the world waiting to be conquered) and the \"Strange Land\" (the far-away planets waiting to be \"discovered\" and tamed)","6063":"These tropes of the genre lend themselves well to the ideology of Othering and marginalisation that undergirds all colonial projects","6064":"For instance, H","6065":"G","6066":"Wells\u2019 19th century sci-fi novel The War of the Worlds, which depicts a London invaded by aliens from Mars, was explicitly inspired by British colonisation and subjugation of indigenous Tasmanians","6067":"What would happen if Martians did to Britain what the British had done to the Tasmanians","6068":"Or to take a more recent example, one of HBO\u2019s sprawling fantasy show Game of Thrones\u2019 many larger plots hinged on Daenerys Targaryen, a light-skinned, princess from the \"Western\" part of the show\u2019s universe bringing to her heel the dark-skinned, savage Dothraki from the \"East\" who eventually come to revere the princess as their conquering and civilising leader, and enthusiastically do her bidding","6069":"The themes of conquest and discovery which sci-fi and fantasy is replete with have their real-life counterparts in the ideology of empire","6070":"We had explored the subgenre called postcolonial sci-fi and fantasy, which turns these very tropes on their heads and uses them to critique and explore the different manifestations of colonialism on cultures, lands and peoples, and which centres colonised or non-Western perspectives instead of mainstream sci-fi\u2019s default of white and Western perspectives","6071":"As we explored Vandana Singh\u2019s steampunk Mughal-era India, for example, or Saad Hossain\u2019s climate-ravaged dystopian Dhaka or Amitav Ghosh\u2019s colonial Calcutta filled with cultists and cyborgs or Mary Anne Mohanraaj\u2019s university-planet settled by South Asians, there was a delight in discovering familiar desi beliefs, histories and worldviews made new by situating them within the tropes of speculative fiction","6072":"It was remarkable to both my students and myself how sci-fi and fantasy could give us a new vocabulary with which to articulate and unpack everything from the anti-encroachment drive that was then sweeping through Karachi to drone attacks in North Waziristan to the gender and sexual politics of contemporary South Asia","6073":"My students\u2019 approach to Afrofuturism and novels such as Kindred was somewhat different than the aforementioned delight in the familiar made new \u2014 the process of studying these texts gave them the chance to learn more about the histories of Black Americans and Africans, of which most were not very familiar","6074":"I sensed that there was a vague idea amongst students that South Asia\u2019s history of colonisation and the African American history of slavery were somehow equivalent, but without the specific understanding of what this history of slavery actually entailed, or the ways in which this history continues to live on in the marginalisation of Black people in contemporary America","6075":"The Pakistani education system does not equip students with an understanding of the history of the African continent, or of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, which brought over 12 million African people to the Americas (comprising two-thirds of everyone who crossed the Atlantic during the formation of the \"New World\" colonies)","6076":"This lack of historical understanding is despite the fact that the histories of colonialism in South Asia and the enslavement of Black people are overlapping and intertwined \u2014 for instance, after the slave trade was finally abolished in the early 19th century, over two million Indians were transported to European colonies in the Americas as indentured labourers as a substitute for slave labour, which gave birth to a large Indian diaspora in places like the Caribbean (in countries such as Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana)","6077":"Also forgotten is the movement of people from Africa to the subcontinent before colonial times and the deep transcontinental trade ties between the two regions, resulting in, for example, the presence of the Sheedi community in contemporary India and Pakistan, who are descendants of East Africans that form a much marginalised minority in both countries (the word Sheedi itself literally means \"black\" and was historically used to refer to slaves, although the community has now reclaimed the term)","6078":"Also read: Teaching literature on female friendship in the #MeToo eraThe absence of knowledge about the histories and cultures of Black people has combined with other factors to produce an enduring attitude of anti-blackness within South Asians, and an overall ignorance of Black people\u2019s lives","6079":"I remember a bewildering conversation, in another classroom, with a couple of students who were passionately defending their right to use the n-word \u2014 a racial slur whose violent context they seemed to be either unaware of or indifferent to","6080":"As this turned into a larger classroom discussion, with some students chiming in to clarify the slur\u2019s long violent history, while others digging in their heels about wanting to use the slur anyway, I realised that many more of such conversations are needed in classrooms and outside of them, so that we might be compelled to challenge our own unwillingness to view Black people in the full breadth of their humanity","6081":"As it is, in a context where contemporary South Asian people\u2019s access to Black people\u2019s humanities is filtered through the deeply and systemically racist Western media and popular culture to reinforce our own anti-black biases, teaching Afrofuturism in a Pakistani classroom provided my students with a unique point of entry into the rich and varied cultures, mythologies and worldviews of Blackness, all the while expanding and exploding their conception of what sci-fi and fantasy can do","6082":"The term Afrofuturism was coined by scholar Mark Dery in his 1994 essay Black to the Future, but the concept existed for decades before the term \u2014 for instance, an early Afrofuturist short story was \"The Comet\" written by Black theorist and activist W","6083":"E","6084":"B","6085":"Dubois in 1920, in which a comet kills everyone in New York City except for a Black man and a wealthy white woman","6086":"In his essay, in which he interviews various black sci-fi writers of the time, Dery argues that the dearth of black writers in mainstream American sci-fi is \"especially perplexing in light of the fact that African Americans, in a very real sense, are the descendants of alien abductees: they inhabit a sci-fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements; official histories undo what has been done; and technology is too often brought to bear on black bodies\"","6087":"The question that the tradition of Afrofuturism tries to answer is: Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose present continues to be mired by violence and oppression, imagine possible futures for themselves","6088":"This question is answered through a wide variety of genres and media, apart from literature, film and television, including music and visual art and design (in contemporary music, singer-songwriter Janelle Monae\u2019s style is decidedly Afrofuturist, for example, as can be seen by the references to androids, electric sheep, time travel, and a prophecy about a cyborg messiah who will unite the whole world that populate her lyrics as well as the visual landscape of her music videos)","6089":"In her book, Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture (2013), Yatasha Womack argues that Afrofuturism\u2019s \"intrigue with sci-fi and fantasy itself inverts conventional thinking about black identity and holds the imagination supreme","6090":"Black identity does not have to be a negotiation with awful stereotypes, a dystopian view of the race, an abysmal sense of powerlessness, or a reckoning of hardened realities\"","6091":"Afrofuturism allows Black artists and writers to disregard the racist and reductive ways in which mainstream white, Western popular culture imagines them, and tell their own stories using their own metaphors and myths and languages; to interrogate and explore their own histories and to imagine their own possible futures","6092":"At the time when I was teaching this course, the most well-known example of Afrofuturism that had recently burst onto the scene was Marvel\u2019s film Black Panther","6093":"Somewhat of an aberration in Marvel\u2019s pantheon of superhero adventures, Black Panther is the only film of the franchise to centre a Black superhero and a vast variety of Black characters","6094":"The film takes place in Wakanda, a fictional African nation that has a rich depository of an otherworldly metal that gives the country\u2019s ruler superpowers and has allowed Wakanda to successfully fight off Western attempts to colonise it or enslave its people","6095":"The world of Black Panther is a joyful ode to Black cultural heritage combined with nuanced Afrocentric visions for the future, and it explores conversations of Pan-Africanism and Black liberation with surprising nuance, given Marvel\u2019s overall aversion to articulating radical politics","6096":"I remember a student\u2019s particularly well-thought-out presentation on the film\u2019s radical vision of Black lives as embodied in the film\u2019s villain, Killmonger\u2019s revolutionary politics, and then the impassioned class discussion on whether or not Killmonger truly deserved the label of villain when the Black liberation he called for seemed quite reasonable","6097":"My students and I also discussed the ways in which Afrofuturism manifests itself in the world-building of Wakanda","6098":"The film is a fascinating embodiment of a principle tenet of Afrofuturism, which is to reclaim Black people\u2019s past by way of imagining their futures","6099":"Because of slavery, most Black people in the Americas were cut off from their heritage, culture and tradition back in Africa","6100":"As Black sci-fi writer and abolitionist Martin R","6101":"Delany explains in Mark Dery\u2019s 1994 essay Black to the Future, \"I have no idea where, in Africa, my ancestors came from because when they reached the slave markets of New Orleans, records of such things were systematically destroyed","6102":"If they spoke their own languages, they were beaten or killed","6103":"The slave pens in which they were stored were set up so that no two slaves from the same area were allowed to be together","6104":"Children were regularly sold away from their parents","6105":"And every effort conceivable was made to destroy all vestiges of what might endure as African social consciousness","6106":"When we say that this country was founded on slavery, we must remember that we mean, specifically, that it was founded on the systematic, conscientious and massive destruction of African cultural remnants","6107":"\" In such a context, Afrofuturist texts attempting to imagine a future by basing it on Black culture and traditions takes on an added poignancy","6108":"There is also a radicalness in Black people imagining joyful, fantastical futures for themselves, in defiance of the violence that has scarred their past and continues to scar their presents","6109":"The images and stories of Black people that South Asians are most familiar with tend to be in the context of violence or suffering, because that is another way that a racist system can dehumanise a people \u2014 show them only in a particular way over and over again","6110":"And even though it is important to contend with the violent systems that continue to oppress Black people, only consuming stories of Black pain risks commodifying their collective traumas","6111":"Afrofuturism\u2019s commitment to imagining better futures for Black people, filled with joy and liberation is then a way of reclaiming their humanity from these reductive stereotypes","6112":"As John Jennings, a professor of media and cultural studies at the University of California Riverside, who has taught Afrofuturism, says in an interview, \"The future for black people in America was supposed to be connected to only three spaces: one, the hold of a slave ship; two, the plantation; and three, the grave","6113":"The construction of a space of agency, joy, and true freedom has always been the central focus of black speculative culture","6114":"\" Afrofuturism offers a vast variety of texts that revel in the delight of imagining fantastical possibilities: Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky by Kwame Mbalia is a middle grade fantasy novel that draws on West African and African American mythology to tell the story of a young boy who has to save a fantastical realm; the Binti series by Nigerian-American Nnedi Okorafor is a delight space opera about a young African girl who is invited to a prestigious intergalactic university, where ancient African cultures collide with the future; Jamaican-Canadian writer Nalo Hopkinson\u2019s Brown Girl in the Ring draws on Afro-Caribbean folklore to imagine a post-apocalyptic Toronto filled with magic and gods","6115":"Read further: Did you know","6116":"Pakistan's first sci-fi film \u2018Shanee\u2019 released in 1989Even when it does engage with a violent and painful past, Afrofuturism finds ways of exploring Black history in inventive ways","6117":"One way Afrofuturist texts do that is by combining elements of steampunk (a subgenre of sci-fi and fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery to explore alternate histories and the social and political conditions of the time) with African mythologies","6118":"For instance, my students and I had an exciting time dissecting Afro-Carribean writer P","6119":"Djeli Clark\u2019s novella The Black God\u2019s Drums, which

spread over 5,000 years despite geographical divisions over different periods \u2014 have kept up their unity as one cultural identity and stand as one nation in terms of social, cultural, traditional and literary backgrounds, despite their unique tribal traits","6186":"Pakhtuns have lived between the coast of Oxus (the Amu River flowing through Central Asia and Afghanistan) and the Indus River since ancient times","6187":"Each tribe has its distinct traits and ways, but they collectively remain centred on one focal point: the code of \u2018Pakhtunwali\u2019, which includes their history, values and rules governing their everyday lives","6188":"It constitutes the very essence from which Pakhtuns draw spirit and potential strength","6189":"The language \u2014 Pakhto or Pashto \u2014 is crucial in preserving, propagating and promoting Pakhtunwali","6190":"Interestingly, speaking Pashto is considered completely different from doing or performing Pakhto","6191":"As noted Pashto writer Rokhan Yousufzai explains, \u201cPakhto is not only a language or tool of expression, but also a practical exhibition of all social, moral, cultural, psychological and traditional values that come under Pakhtunwali","6192":"In other words, Pakhto is both a language and code of conduct at the same time, and this characteristic distinguishes it from other languages","6193":"\u201dAccording to senior research scholar Mushtaq Majrooh, Pashto literature is replete with references to Pakhtunwali","6194":"From Rahman Baba and Khushal Khan Khattak, to Ghani Khan, Qalandar Moomand, Ajmal Khattak and Rahmat Shah Sail, scores of Pashto literati have written profusely on various aspects of Pakhtunwali, glorifying its positive shades and also advocating changes to it","6195":"\u201cPashto poets have a natural propensity to show attachment to Pakhtunwali and even the great Sufi poet Amir Hamza Shinwari composed poems and couplets about it scattered through the bulk of his works,\u201d comments Majrooh","6196":"\u201cAfter Sufism, Pakhtunwali is the second major subject of Hamza Baba\u2019s writings, and every single Pashto poet and writer must make a reference to Pakhtunwali\u2019s code of ethics in his or her literary works","6197":"The mention of Pakhtunwali makes up one-third of almost every Pashto writer\u2019s writings","6198":"\u201d Revisiting Pakhtunwali, the code of conduct which encapsulates the rich Pakhtun history and culture, reveals the true status it provides womenRokhan Yousafzai elaborates: \u201cPakhtuns have lively literary and cultural traditions","6199":"The tapa is a three-line verse that encompasses the entire lifestyle of the Pakhtuns \u2014 most interestingly, this literary genre was created by Pakhtun women","6200":"Pakhtuns admire their poets, writers, political leaders and social reformers who have contributed to Pakhtunwali","6201":"\u201d Well-known research scholar Professor Abaseen Yousafzai says that \u201cContradictions and controversies are always there, but Pakhtuns are unanimous on Pakhtunwali","6202":"\u201d One can easily understand the corpus lingua of Pakhtuns \u2014 their history and their social, religious, cultural, literary, psychological and political perspectives \u2014 in the light of Pakhtunwali, as it is a mirror to Pakhtun lifestyle in its entirety, irrespective of the people\u2019s geographical and tribal divisions","6203":"The Pakhtunwali code of conduct is so strong that any Pakhtun found guilty of violating it has to face not only public wrath and humiliation, but is also excommunicated","6204":"A Pakhtun could be excused if he fails to fulfil any religious obligation, but violation of Pakhtunwali is unbearable in a typical Pakhtun society","6205":"An ordinary Pakhtun may not mind if someone tells him that he is not Afghan and terms him \u2018Pakhtun\u2019 instead; only Pakhtun poets, writers and a few intellectuals will differ and try to prove their identity as Afghans","6206":"Similarly, Pakhtuns will be least bothered if someone declares them undeserving of being called Pathan, Sulemani or Rohi","6207":"But if a Pakhtun is taunted as being baiPakhto \u2014 sans Pakhto, or one who does not practice Pakhtunwali \u2014 then he will roll up his sleeves, ready to fight, because a true Pakhtun knows what social repercussions will follow if one accepts he is not doing Pakhto","6208":"According to scholars, the word \u2018Pakhtun\u2019 is composed of five Pashto letters: paa, kheen, taa, wao and noon, and each stands for a particular characteristic that embodies Pakhtunwali","6209":"Rokhan Yousafzai informs us that paa stands for pat or modesty; kheen denotes khegara or the act of performing welfare or doing good to others; taa stands for tura meaning talwaar or a sword, symbolising bravery; wao shows wafa or loyalty and noon stands for nang or honour","6210":"The late professor Parishan Khattak writes in his celebrated book Pashtun Kon [Who Is A Pashtun] that \u201cPakhtunwali is a philosophy of life among people who have been borrowing ideas from the ways of ancient predecessors, some thoughts from their surroundings and have drawn some inspiration from dialogue of other nations and religions living in their close vicinity","6211":"\u201d He adds that Pakhtuns had originally been Zoroastrians and Buddhists and, after the arrival of Islam, found many Islamic traditions and social norms compatible with those already existing in Pakhtunwali, which is \u201ca moral system that believes in social welfare, justice, equality and humanism, deeply rooted in cultural practices that demand devotion, bravery, hospitality and sense of honour","6212":"\u201d In his Urdu-language book Pakhtun Culture Ke Khadd-o-Khal [The Outlines of Pakhtun Culture], Rokhan Yousafzai writes that melmastia [hospitality], panah [providing shelter to the unguarded], badal [a social tradition in which good deeds are exchanged], jirga [system of consultation], nanawate [reconciliation], tega [ceasefire] and hujra [village guest house] are the very foundations of Pakhtunwali","6213":"However, the problem is that Pakhtuns themselves have misinterpreted these terminologies more than others and even wrong practices in the name Pakhtunwali have replaced the indigenous traditions that were once touted as the glory of the Pakhtun nation","6214":"It is also a cultural ideology which is inclusive of women\u2019s rights, contrary to what is widely believed","6215":"Sana Ejaz, a noted rights\u2019 activist and leader of the Pakhtun women\u2019s Waak Tehreek [Empowerment Movement], believes that Pakhtunwali \u2014 like other moral and cultural systems \u2014 is dynamic and subservient to change","6216":"She says that visionary Pakhtun leaders stressed the inclusion of Pakhtun women in political struggles and advocated for women\u2019s participation in all spheres of life","6217":"\u201cBacha Khan motivated his own daughter to get an education, inspired women to write in Pakhtun \u2014 a literary\/political magazine that was the mouthpiece of Pakhtuns in the early 20th century against the British Raj \u2014 and called for women to form their own political organisations","6218":"[Pashtun nationalist and political leader] Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai nominated his daughter \u2014 instead of a male relative \u2014 to run the affairs of his home while he was in jail [under British rule], and would communicate with her from prison through letters","6219":"Things have changed a lot, but Pakhtun women still have a long way to go to bring about a significant change in the overall set-up of Pakhtunwali,\u201d she states","6220":"Ejaz says the main objective of Waak Tehreek is to motivate Pakhtun women to play their role in society through getting access to quality education, healthcare and political posts, so that they change outdated norms perpetuated in the name of honour, and pave the way for young girls to know their social, political and human rights","6221":"Professor Abaseen Yousafzai is of the opinion that Pakhtunwali is not a hurdle in the way of women\u2019s empowerment and Pakhtun women have long played an effective role in almost every walk of life, noting that Malala Maiwand has been a symbol of political struggle from the British era till today","6222":"\u201cThree years ago, some women writers approached me for advice on founding a separate organisation of writers and poets","6223":"I encouraged them and even suggested a name \u2014 Khwendy Adabi Lakhkar [Sisters\u2019 Literary Army]","6224":"I am pleased that they have been very active \u2014 more than men \u2014 as their numbers have swelled from just a few to hundreds","6225":"The vision of Bacha Khan and many of our intellectuals encouraged the role and participation of Pakhtun women in the society","6226":"\u201d Regarding revisiting Pakhtunwali, especially the component of jirga, he agrees that some outdated, irrelevant and inhuman practices, such as swara [giving girls in marriage without their consent to resolve conflicts] and ghag [again, forcible marriage without a girl\u2019s consent], need to be discarded because the original system of jirga has been corrupted, as have other values","6227":"\u201cPakhtunwali is open to modern criticism,\u201d he says","6228":"\u201cWomen\u2019s role must be encouraged and their due rights \u2014 including the power to make decisions, right to education and share inheritance \u2014 are pressing issues","6229":"\u201d  Abaseen Yousafzai admits that, keeping in view the particular environment of Pakhtuns, the role of women was not very significant in earlier times","6230":"Still, change is inevitable and must come through, he says","6231":"He adds that history is witness to tales of the bravery that Pakhtun women have had displayed alongside men","6232":"\u201cWomen enjoy a special status and respect in Pakhtunwali","6233":"However, revisiting [the code] will widen its scope and significance in today\u2019s modern world","6234":"\u201dThe writer teaches English in

or an older close family friend, but Auntie Agni wants to remind you that respect has to be earned","6338":"You have to stop respecting and protecting this woman just because she is a family friend and older than you","6339":"She has clearly proved that she is a harasser and a bully","6340":"See her for the horrible human being that she is","6341":"Finally, once you have gathered the evidence against your harasser auntie, confront her","6342":"I hope you find the strength to do this yourself","6343":"However, if that is not possible, your witness could do it on your behalf","6344":"When you have your evidence ready, send it to her next time she DMs you","6345":"Share the screenshots and recordings of her calls and say you have told a friend and are considering taking it to the police or sharing with her husband and your family","6346":"The mere threat that you will expose this woman will most likely end the harassment","6347":"Even if initially you did respond to her overtures, you are a minor and so the case against her is very strong","6348":"You just have to collect the evidence and confront her","6349":"Remind yourself repeatedly that harasser auntie has more to lose than you, such as her marriage and respect in society, if you make the evidence public","6350":"Please, please, please find the strength to do this","6351":"You can confront her yourself if you feel able; or your trusted person or witness can do it on your behalf","6352":"The important point here is to expose her and call her out","6353":"I hope this helps","6354":"Auntie will not reply privately

against Pakistan at Southampton on Thursday as Fawad Alam's long wait for a Test recall ended with a duck","6358":"Pakistan were 126-5 at stumps after a combination of rain and bad light cut short play on the first day of the second Test","6359":"Anderson had taken 2-35 from 15 overs to move to within eight wickets of becoming the first paceman with 600 in Tests","6360":"All of England's four quicks enjoyed success, with only Pakistan opener Abid Ali \u2014 dropped twice in the slips \u2014 offering prolonged resistance during an innings of 60","6361":"Anderson came into this match having taken just six wickets in three previous Tests this season, at an expensive average of over 41","6362":"By his own admission, he had not been at his best with a match haul of 1-67 during England's three-wicket win in the first Test at his Old Trafford home ground last week","6363":"But the 38-year-old denied rumours he was considering retirement, with England captain Joe Root saying on the eve of this match: \u201cTo question Jimmy's ability and his record \u2014 do that at your own peril","6364":"\u201d And it was not long before England's all-time leading wicket-taker struck after Pakistan captain Azhar Ali won the toss","6365":"In humid conditions conducive to Anderson's bowling, he needed just eight balls to have Shan Masood, fresh from his Test-best 156, lbw for one with an inswinger to the left-hander","6366":"Masood was so clearly out, he did not bother to review the decision","6367":"Pakistan should have been 7-2 but Abid, on one, was reprieved when third slip Dom Sibley dropped an edge off Stuart Broad","6368":"Azhar, under pressure after a run of just one fifty in 10 innings since becoming skipper in November, was nearly out for seven when, playing defensively at in-form all-rounder Chris Woakes, the ball trickled onto his stumps without dislodging the bails","6369":"Woakes suffered again when Abid, on 21, got dropped by second slip Rory Burns","6370":"But Pakistan's luck ran out when Azhar, on 20, edged a full-length Anderson delivery and this time Burns held a good, low catch to leave Pakistan 78-2","6371":"The only bowlers to have taken more than Anderson's 592 Test wickets are a trio of retired spinners","6372":"Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan leads the way with 800, while Australia's Shane Warne has 708 and India's Anil Kumble 619","6373":"Abid completed a 99-ball fifty featuring six fours after tea","6374":"But left-arm seamer Sam Curran, recalled in place of fast bowler Jofra Archer, had Abid taken in the slips by Burns with a ball that angled across the right-hander following a couple of inswingers","6375":"Sibley, to his evident relief, held a slip catch off Broad as Asad Shafiq fell cheaply","6376":"Alam, a prolific run-scorer in Pakistan domestic cricket, played the last of his three previous Tests, in which he averages over 41, against New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009","6377":"The 34-year-old was the only change to the side after replacing leg-spinning all-rounder Shadab Khan","6378":"But Alam lasted just five minutes at the crease","6379":"Batting with an extremely open stance, Alam was lbw for a four-ball nought to Woakes","6380":"Alam was initially given not out but an England review revealed the ball had pitched in line, with a squared-up Alam in front of his stumps","6381":"England, as well as recalling Curran, made an expected change when batsman Zak Crawley returned in place of Ben Stokes","6382":"Star all-rounder Stokes is missing the final two matches of this series for personal reasons after travelling to New Zealand to be with his ill father","6383":"Phew, Mahesh Bhatt's directorial comeback, Sadak 2 is not off to a good start","6384":"The trailer for the upcoming Bollywood flick has racked up nearly 7 million dislikes on YouTube, owing to the fact that the movie stars Bhatt's daughter, Alia Bhatt in the lead role and the debate on star kids and nepotism is currently under a magnifying glass in India, especially following Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide","6385":"Now, the movie is being slammed on Twitter for possibly plagiarising the work of a Pakistani musician","6386":"Shezan Saleem who goes by JO-G tweeted a video playing both his composition from 2011 for 'Rabba Ho' by Zaid Khan and the new trailer track from Sadak 2 called 'Ishq Kamaal': Saleem asked followers to weigh in and share what they think and most agreed with him that the two tunes sounded pretty much identical","6387":"However, he also clarified that he was not attacking the Bhatt family: Pooja Bhatt, Mahesh's other daughter who also stars in the movie had previously shared that they will be introducing fresh talent with the soundtrack","6388":"\"Sadak 2 gives birth to a brand new talent in the form of Sunlijeet","6389":"A music teacher from Chandigarh who came to our office with no prior appointment, a dream, a harmonium and a brilliant song called

memes","6435":"Star power helps fashion sell","6436":"It draws eyeballs towards a campaign, allowing it to stand out from amongst the many, many others that are constantly infiltrating the market","6437":"Considerable sums of money are paid to celebrities to walk the runway for a brand as a showstopper","6438":"Marketing budgets are especially allotted to grand campaigns revolving around \u2018it\u2019 stars","6439":"Sometimes, star power can even generate sales for some truly lacklustre designs","6440":"And every designer \u2014the good, the bad and the very, very ugly\u2014 will agree that heavy-duty spending on celebrity endorsements has reaped big profits for them","6441":"While fashion purists will always argue that famous brand ambassadors take away the spotlight from the fashion itself, we live in a world that is completely smitten with celebrity culture \u2014where customers connect better with designs when they are worn by a famous, well-loved personality","6442":"Menswear designer Omar Farooq of Republic, for instance, has often reminisced about how people would come to his store holding images of actor Fawad Khan wearing his designs, on the catwalk as well as in shoots","6443":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT His brand had been in its fledgeling years when Khan had shown a decisive preference for it","6444":"For a while \u2014 and especially through most of the actor\u2019s Bollywood tryst \u2014 Khan was associated with Republic Menswear and it did wonders for the brand\u2019s sales and image","6445":"Similarly, many of Emraan Rajput\u2019s customers have a penchant for the designs worn by Bilal Abbas Khan","6446":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Iqra Aziz\u2019s wedding dress by Nomi Ansari was a complete hit, as was the Zainab Chottani bridal that Sajal Aly wore in her drama Yeh Dil Mera","6447":"And all through Ramzan this year, stars participating in Fahad Mustafa\u2019s game show for ARY Digital, Jeeto Pakistan, predominantly wore designs by Rizwan Beyg and Ansab Jahangir, hauling in sales for both brands even in these desultory Covid-infested times","6448":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Lately, though, an all-new epiphany has hit local designers","6449":"They have pondered over what could be better than one celebrity endorsement and some of them have evidently realized that it\u2019s many celebrity endorsements","6450":"The concept itself is not unfamiliar","6451":"Back in 2016, I recall attending a Bridal Couture Week edition where a fashion showcase by Amir Adnan featured a whopping 17 celebrities","6452":"More recently, at the winter festive edition of last year\u2019s Fashion Pakistan Week, designer Humayun Alamgir showcased his suiting range with the aid of six celebrity showstoppers who danced and jumped about on the catwalk","6453":"The concept has now also filtered down to the domain of unstitched fabric campaigns","6454":"Zainab Chottani, possibly the first designer to take multiple celebrities on board in a shoot, says that it really helps in generating hype for her collection of unstitched formal-wear","6455":"As part of the promotions of the designer\u2019s Jamdani Wedding Festive line, which released in October last year, a number of actresses were featured on Instagram, wearing the collection","6456":"Sajal Aly, Saboor Aly, Ayeza Khan, Ushna Shah, Mehwish Hayat, Ramsha Khan and Sanam Jung \u2013 veteran actresses as well as some from the younger lot were part of the campaign","6457":"The concept was repeated in last year\u2019s winter shawl collection and has just floated out on to Instagram yet again, marketing the soon to release festive collection","6458":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT \u201cWe tried working with multiple celebrities for the first time last year,\u201d says Chottani","6459":"\u201cThe campaign was only for social media and while it was professionally shot, we constructed the images around a \u2018Spotted in Zainab Chottani\u2019 storyline","6460":"We deliberately kept the treatment of the shoot very casual, as if the actresses had all chosen their outfits themselves","6461":"\u201dA photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT She continues, \u201cOur lawn campaign has a different structure","6462":"It\u2019s shot at an exotic location and a single celebrity brand ambassador is the face of the collection","6463":"But with the luxury formal-wear line, multiple celebrities work out well","6464":"\u201dOn a less extensive scale, Ansab Jahangir is another brand that likes to work on fashion shoots that feature two actresses \u2014 instead of one \u2014 as well as fashion models","6465":"The bridal-wear campaign for October 2019, for instance, featured actresses Ayeza Khan as well as Amna Ilyas","6466":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Zoha Shakir, the brand\u2019s co-owner, observes, \u201cWe just want to show different looks on women with different body types","6467":"Some customers may be able to connect better with an image of a well-loved actress while others may appreciate how the designs look on a model","6468":"And the celebrities working with us do have huge fan followings and it helps generate mileage for us","6469":"\u201dAsim Jofa, meanwhile, has just gone all-out in an extravagant shoot for his unstitched \u2018Naubahar\u2019 line","6470":"The recently released images of the collection showcases 10 top-tier actresses, laden in zari and sequins and surrounded with lavish florals, glinting candles, garlands and even the occasional torso of a horse","6471":"The clothes are set off with teekas and chokers and the actresses look quite glamorous","6472":"A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT \u201cI put a lot of thought into what everyone would be wearing,\u201d says Asim Jofa","6473":"\u201cThe embroidery and the colour was chosen according to each actress\u2019 specific personality","6474":"My daughter designed each set and we photographed each celebrity separately, one after the other, in a shoot that went on for 72 hours","6475":"I wanted all of them to truly enjoy the experience and they all very happily posted their pictures","6476":"On the day of the collection\u2019s release, I asked all of them to post pictures from the campaign simultaneously, on Instagram","6477":"They all have millions of followers","6478":"Imagine the extensive audience we reached in those few minutes","6479":"\u201dA photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT A photo posted by

lawn line","6480":"The trend, it seems, is on the rise and there will be many more such campaigns","6481":"There are only a limited number of popular \u2018it\u2019 actresses in Pakistan\u2019s entertainment industry","6482":"They have huge followings and many boast an impressive repertoire of work","6483":"They do have the clout to draw in sales when they appear in a single campaign","6484":"But when they work with one brand after the other, appearing in a new shoot every week, the images start looking repetitive","6485":"A quick scan through Instagram proves this","6486":"You may admire Ayeza Khan wearing an embellished suit but the next day, you may like her just as much in a formal tunic by another designer","6487":"And any die-hard fan of Ayeza, wanting to emulate her, can happily sift through multiple brands, all endorsed by her, before making a purchase","6488":"By working with dozens of brands every season, celebrities act as models rather than brand ambassadors","6489":"It must certainly be very lucrative for the stars but from the brands\u2019 perspective, it doesn\u2019t really help them in carving a distinctive identity","6490":"And the images can\u2019t have the impact that a single major actress can make as the face of a brand when she signs a contract of exclusivity for a certain period of time","6491":"A case in point, once again, could be Ayeza Khan, who made waves for AlKaram all through last year, when it was the only high-street brand that she could work with","6492":"And I\u2019ll take the higher road of the fashion purist and observe that above all, long term brand loyalty cannot be gained merely through celebrity mileage","6493":"Good design, an eye for quality and competitive prices are necessary to build a brand with a strong customer base","6494":"A famous face for the brand \u2014 or a plethora of celebrities \u2014 can only do so much","6495":"Unless, of course, a brand manages to score a coup and take on board a highly coveted celebrity for the very first time in Pakistan","6496":"A certain much-hyped, much-loved Turkish actress comes to mind who is busy signing advertising deals in Pakistan these days and keeps hinting that she will be visiting us soon, once the coronavirus has run its course","6497":"If \u2014 and when \u2014 such a brand collaboration does take place, the sales and euphoria will serve as an example of how star power can really work wonders (or not)  for a brand","6498":"I\u2019ll write that particular story when the time comes","6499":"The bodies of 11 people from a single family were found in a field in India's Jodhpur district in Rajasthan state, BBC Urdu reported on Sunday","6500":"According to the report, the family had migrated to India from Pakistan

depends on groundwater to sustain its agricultural production and to ensure food security","6565":"However, it is feared that the on-going unsustainable groundwater abstractions might have serious repercussions to the sustainability of the agrarian economy of Pakistan","6566":"After the green revolution of the 1960s, groundwater use in irrigation has been increasing steadily in Pakistan","6567":"Between 1960 and 2010, the overall groundwater share to irrigation water supplies increased from nearly 8 per cent to more than 60pc","6568":"The massive increase in groundwater use over the past few decades has been a result of open access to groundwater through large scale tube-well development","6569":"The outset of tube-well technology in Pakistan was largely facilitated by the government\u2019s aid and support policies but without exercising any regulatory mechanisms to date","6570":"Consequently, the number of tube-wells has gone over 1","6571":"3 million in the country and we have yet to develop an overall coherent groundwater regulatory mechanism and consistent policy to manage and use our groundwater resources","6572":"Our current water policy is lopsided, generic and without a clearly defined timeline to achieve any objectives related to groundwater management set in the water policy","6573":"Pakistan\u2019s irrigation water demand is predicted to go beyond 110km3 by 2025 under the business-as-usual scenario which is expected to be met mainly through groundwater abstraction","6574":"Currently, groundwater contributes about 65km3 to the overall irrigation water requirements","6575":"Converting electricity-operated tube wells to solar-powered ones can help save at least Rs100bn as well as 4,000MWs of electricityFor this purpose, farmers mostly rely on diesel or electricity operated tube-wells with typical capacities ranging from 5 to 25 horsepower","6576":"Currently, there are 1","6577":"06m diesel operated tube-wells whereas 0","6578":"325m are connected to the national power grid which require an operational total load of 4,097 megawatts of electricity","6579":"This is roughly 17pc of the overall electricity consumption in Pakistan","6580":"Majority of these tube-wells are energy inefficient and a burden on the national exchequer","6581":"On one hand, the government pays billions in terms of subsidies for these tube-wells, but on the other hand, the rate of recovery from these tube-wells remains very poor","6582":"For example, during May 2019, the Pakistan Electric Power Company reported only 34pc recovery by receiving Rs3","6583":"2bn out of a total assessment of Rs9","6584":"4bn for the month","6585":"Converting electricity operated tube-wells to solar-powered tube-wells can help save at least Rs100bn which the government spends each year in terms of giving subsidies while saving more than 4,000MWs of electricity","6586":"Quite recently, the federal government has allocated Rs90m for undertaking a consultancy for assessing the feasibility of replacing the 30,000 electricity tube-wells by solar-powered tube-wells in Balochistan","6587":"Similarly, the government is also mulling over installing more solar-powered tube-wells in different areas of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh","6588":"Besides various policies and strategies to harness power from renewable resources, different feasibilities have been undertaken on the prospects of exploiting and promoting renewable energy (particularly solar energy) in the agriculture sector","6589":"Different packages, policies and plans have been introduced by the government, which include duty-free import of solar photovoltaic modules and attractive financing mechanisms for borrowers with the help of the State Bank of Pakistan","6590":"According to the Agricultural Credit and Microfinance Department of the State Bank of Pakistan, the banks lent some Rs131","6591":"2m for installation of tube-wells, including solar-powered ones","6592":"The Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited disbursed Rs25","6593":"65m over 2015-2017 to support solar-powered tube-wells mainly in Balochistan","6594":"Pakistan is at the threshold of a revolution in the field of Solar Powered Irrigation Systems which have the potential to unleash the typical energy-groundwater nexus in Pakistan","6595":"As indicated in the National Water Policy 2017, the government is committed to exploiting this potential","6596":"Over the past few years, the number of solar-powered pumps will have grown steadily as well-off farmers have started installing them without any support from the government","6597":"However, in the wake of groundwater scarcity, it is imperative to consider that solar-powered tube-wells, if not adequately managed and regulated, may lead to unsustainable groundwater use","6598":"Groundwater governance is a complex phenomenon which requires multidimensional approaches and actions that integrate institutions, policies, tools and technologies","6599":"The complexity of groundwater governance is not only associated with solar-powered groundwater pumping but is also associated with conventional groundwater pumping systems and practices","6600":"Regardless, whether it is a conventional groundwater irrigation system or a solar-powered tube-well, a holistic groundwater governance approach includes consistent groundwater monitoring, education and awareness","6601":"Nevertheless, evidence indicates that solar-powered tube-wells bear a relatively higher risk of fostering groundwater over-exploitation as there is no recurring input cost involved rather there is an incentive to intensify and expand the scale of operation through more and more pumping","6602":"It is, therefore, more important to complement solar-powered tube-well expansion with sustainable groundwater use policies","6603":"The recommendations for the installation of different types of tube-wells promised to be formulated in the National Water Policy 2018 can be an important policy intervention towards groundwater management if formulated and enforced","6604":"These recommendations could include area-specific groundwater licensing rules along with a set of complementary groundwater monitoring and sanctioning policies","6605":"The writer can be reached at arif","6606":"watto@uaf","6607":"edu","6608":"pkPublished in Dawn, The

even as the final stage of clinical trials to test safety and efficacy continue","6611":"The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out its vaccine highlights its determination to win the global race

soon start mass producing the vaccine","6616":"Its approval by the health ministry foreshadows the start of a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase III trial","6617":"Such trials, which require a certain rate of participants catching the virus to observe the vaccine's effect, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval","6618":"Regulators around the world have insisted that the rush to develop Covid-19 vaccines will not compromise safety","6619":"But recent surveys show growing public distrust in governments' efforts to rapidly produce such a vaccine","6620":"Russian health workers treating Covid-19 patients will be offered the chance of volunteering to be vaccinated soon after the vaccine's

III human trials, according to WHO data","6623":"EIDUL Azha, the festival of sacrifice, did not feel like the same this year","6624":"The difference was not in spirit but in the visibility of celebrations owing to mostly Covid-19\u2013inspired reasons","6625":"The size of the market did shrink massively for economic and health reasons but the countrywide shrinkage was perhaps less significant than what it felt like in cities like Karachi and Lahore","6626":"The slump in the volume of sacrificial activity in major cities was compensated partially by the hike in animal sacrifices in rural Pakistan this year","6627":"The difference in the volume of business was marked in Karachi, Lahore and other big cities of Punjab but not as obvious in Quetta, Peshawar and other cities of the three smaller provinces, our telephonic survey revealed","6628":"The reasons forwarded include a higher level of awareness and better governmental oversight in the top-tier cities of Punjab and Karachi","6629":"The sudden announcement of a smart lockdown in Punjab days before Eid to pre-empt a repeat of the hike in Covid-19 cases the country experienced after Eidul Fitr curbed whatever spending was expected in clothes, shoes and accessories for celebrations in the most prosperous province","6630":"As observed in the reports of past years, there is understood to be a net transfer of capital on Eidul Azha from urban to rural Pakistan from where sacrificial animals are sourced","6631":"Some marginal activity around this festival is generated by retail urban investors and animal enthusiasts","6632":"But even in these arrangements, the premium is shared with rural stakeholders who enjoy the upper hand on the strength of their expertise in cattle management","6633":"The size of related economic activities is Rs100bn-110bn this year, down by 50pc from a year agoThe scope of online activity initiated a few years back widened further this year with tech-savvy, wealthier families being inclined towards using options and tools to remotely manage the sacrifice","6634":"A number of companies have cropped up over the years offering their hassle-free services for a price often beyond the reach of the majority","6635":"The numbers have yet to pool to reveal the actual depth of this market or its share in the multi-billion-rupee Eidul Azha economy","6636":"Assuming the last year\u2019s projection of Rs200 billion to be credible, this year the projections based on intelligent estimates place the size of the Eidul Azha economy in the range of Rs100-110bn \u2014 a sizeable drop of 45-50 per cent","6637":"According to people associated with cattle affairs, about one-tenth of the population of cows and goats is offered for sacrifice on this occasion every year","6638":"The trend of collective qurbani (sacrifice), currently encouraged by the state and health professionals to contain the spread of the deadly disease, was stronger as Pakistanis tried to balance their religious duty with the health risk and affordability in a lagging economy","6639":"The more cautious ones opted for the still cheaper option of donating whatever they can afford in the name of God to philanthropic institutions with their promise to use it to sacrifice and feed the poor","6640":"This has changed the ratio of different animals in the sacrificial cattle pool with the share of bulls and cows persistently increasing","6641":"Despite the slump in demand, the prices are reported to be 20-30pc higher than last year","6642":"The leather industry that seeks to capitalise on the one-time hype expected a 50pc fall in the supply of hides this year","6643":"\u201cIn 2019, tanneries picked up hides worth Rs20bn on Eidul Azha but this year the collective business of hides and skins is not expected to stretch beyond Rs10bn,\u201d Syed Shujaat Ali, former chairman of the Pakistan Leather Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told Dawn","6644":"\u201cThe expected fall

consumers are wary of luxury goods, holding their purse strings tight","6646":"\u201d he said","6647":"Sharing the news from the inner circles of leather dealers, he said that buyers have tightened their grip on the hide market since the exit of big, organised hide collectors and sellers","6648":"Their control is exhibited in falling prices since 2015","6649":"\u201cThe asking price of cow skin is Rs700-800 that fetched Rs1,000-1,200 last year and Rs4,000-4,500 in 2015","6650":"The trend is the same for other cattle","6651":"The asking price for goat skin is Rs150 and that of sheep is Rs100","6652":"The background research indicated a shift of sacrificial activity from urban to rural Pakistan, particularly in Punjab where the government was more vigilant to implement coronavirus precautions","6653":"Besides, the population in urban Punjab generally had the option to return to their roots in pinds (villages) or ask their extended families back there to fulfil the religious obligation on their behalf","6654":"In Karachi, however, where the majority does not enjoy the privilege of strong rural links, more families availed the services of institutions offering to carry out sacrifice in sub-developed, far off areas such as Dir and Chitral","6655":"This arrangement, called waqf, is comparatively cheaper and hassle-free","6656":"Compared with the per-share rate of Rs10,000-13,000, in collective qurbani in waqf one share is priced at Rs4,000-4,500","6657":"In waqf, the shareholder does not get to see the animal and has to surrender their claim or say in the distribution of meat after the sacrifice is made somewhere far off","6658":"In the rest of the country, the activity was lukewarm but within the normal range, according to information

that the organisers contacted him and then, refused to answer his calls","6770":"That\u2019s quite shocking","6771":"According to Usman Mukhtar, \u201cWhile I appreciate our industry growing beyond the bounds of our country and spreading our art across the world, I will not appreciate me or my peers being treated with no respect","6772":"I was approached by the PISA team and agreed to attend the

ones reaching out and requesting details and itineraries","6783":"Nothing was provided","6784":"I just read Nabeel\u2019s post right now","6785":"It is one thing to only, say, fly in potential winners, performers and a select few from the industry","6786":"It is another to pursue actors, directors (nominees, mind you), confirm their attendance, get their visas sorted and then disappear","6787":"\u201d\u201cI still wish the PISA team all the best and I hope that they learn from their mistake","6788":"But first they have to acknowledge they made one \u2026 this isn\u2019t about a free trip to Dubai on a private jet","6789":"Most of us had to clear our schedules, request our production teams for days off, put our work on hold","6790":"\u201d Director Saqib Malik said,

came","6794":"I cancelled a shoot and made myself available for two days only because Baaji was nominated for six awards, including Best Director, and I thought that it would be correct for me to attend","6795":"I had no great desire to be there other than to support the event and Pakistani cinema and also because Baaji was nominated for Best Film and Director and I am also the producer of the film","6796":"I was waiting till 2 a","6797":"m","6798":"last night and there was no news","6799":"By speaking to you about this now, I am airing my views","6800":"Like me, there are so many others who have also been treated in the same way","6801":"\u201dActor Ali Safina, in a long post, declared, \u2018The reason why I am writing this is because I feel that these days it seems that anyone can put on an award show where they pretend to honor artists of our industry just to make some gains on ticket money but the ones who suffer in the end are people like me who never signed up for this disrespect but still got dragged into it\u2026\u2019 A photo posted by Instagram (@instagram) on Mar 22, 2015 at 11:21am PDT Significantly, Ali said, \u2018\u2026 Meanwhile it\u2019s a sure shot

celebs are willing to attend an event in exchange for a free paid international tripClearly, Ali was saying something that we suspected all along: a lot of local artists willingly attend an awards ceremony abroad just for the free ticket and hotel stay","6805":"The organisers gain from their celebrity appearance and yet, they don\u2019t pay them for making an appearance","6806":"Moreover, certain local celebs are so overjoyed at the free trip and the chartered plane ride, that they generate mileage for the event by Instagramming about it constantly","6807":"That\u2019s great for the organisers but it does mean that celebrities are selling them for too little","6808":"Actor Ahsan Khan, who is often part of awards ceremonies in Pakistan and abroad, observes, \u201cI think that we all need to support events that celebrate Pakistani talent but at the same time, actors are not realising their self-worth when they decide to go somewhere just for a free trip","6809":"\" \"I was also approached for these awards but I didn\u2019t respond because it is easy to assess when something is credible and when it isn\u2019t","6810":"I think that everyone needs to have enough self-respect and foresight to understand what events they need to avoid","6811":"\u201dThe question is: why did this new awards ceremony blunder so badly at a time when it needs to gather support from the Pakistani entertainment fraternity","6812":"The PISA, of course, are claiming that the disorganisation was due to teething issues","6813":"This was their very first attempt at putting together an awards ceremony and they muddled up the travel plans of some of the people that they had initially invited","6814":"Read: I don\u2019t want to be disrespected for the sake of a show\u2019s rating, says Sajal Aly of the Lux Style AwardsHowever, according to the grapevine, the PISA team hadn\u2019t initially expected that major stars would agree to make an appearance at their event","6815":"They came up with long lists of nominees and invited them all, truly intending to fly them off to Dubai","6816":"But then, stars like Humayun Saeed, Mahira Khan and Ali Zafar also agreed to come to the show and the PISA budget began to stretch thin","6817":"Ultimately, they decided to very quietly \u2018un-invite\u2019 certain others, conveniently choosing to disappear on them rather than inform them that plans had changed","6818":"If this was the case, then certainly it was a teething issue","6819":"Had the team been better organised, they would have decided upon their guest list at the very onset and not had to pick and choose who they would be flying out to Dubai","6820":"But even the fact that this was their first time is no excuse for insulting so many artists who have worked hard on their careers","6821":"The ones in Dubai sadly chose to ignore the disorganisationFurthermore, even if the organisers did mess things up, it\u2019s disheartening that the stars who did reach Dubai didn\u2019t say anything in support of their peers","6822":"A free trip to Dubai \u2013 or anywhere else in the world for that matter \u2013 is no excuse for not speaking out for your co-artistes","6823":"Perhaps artists didn\u2019t want to say anything so that they would still be on the guest list at the next round of awards","6824":"But is an international paid vacation so important that you can\u2019t even float out a single tweet against something which is so clearly wrong","6825":"\u201cThat\u2019s just how we are,\u201d says Teepu Sharif","6826":"\u201cWe are not

regulations and after midnight, the organisers began to get fined colossal sums by the hour","6835":"Ultimately, the show had to be cut short and ended at 2 a","6836":"m","6837":"Some of the performances got skipped \u2013 namely, those by Aima Baig, Strings and Hira Mani \u2013 who was apparently going to make her debut dance performance","6838":"A large number of awards also couldn\u2019t be given out","6839":"As time began to run short, the categories quickly spiraled to the Best Actor and Actress announcements that were supposed to come at the very end","6840":"The supporting actors and actresses had to be ignored","6841":"In an official statement from PISA, it was said, \u201c\u2026 Overall, this inaugural event was a huge success in creating the buzz around Pakistan and its artist community \u2026 Without doubt that the event encountered many challenges to say the least","6842":"An event of this magnitude is a huge undertaking and consequently if anyone during this process has been let down or have been miscommunicated then PISA team takes full responsibility of it","6843":"\" \"We by no means intended to disrespect any of our prestigious guests \u2026 We hope that we have achieved some momentum with our partners and supporters and the team that worked tirelessly for months to bring this to fruition","6844":"We also hope to make PISA an annual event for years to come and improve from the learnings from this year\u2019s event","6845":"\u201dHasan Rizvi of BBPR, handling the PR of the event, commented, \u201cThere was a lot of

unavailability of seats","6848":"In awards of this magnitude, there are definitely teething issues but we hope that PISA eventually becomes a platform that makes Pakistanis all over the world proud","6849":"The show yesterday was everything we could imagine","6850":"May we all continue to support each other and celebrate Pakistani cinema and fashion","6851":"\u201d But how were the PISA\u2019s extending their support to the local artist community by ignoring some and lauding others, even flying them out on a private jet","6852":"How was the show everything that could be imagined, when it was allegedly cut short","6853":"As Osman Khalid Butt pointed out, \u201cThis is about disrespecting the same fraternity folk you\u2019ve advertised your ceremony around","6854":"\u201dLet\u2019s not gloss over the facts","6855":"And teething issues notwithstanding, an artist community that does not support each other needs to work on correcting itself","6856":"The PISA\u2019s blundered \u2013 other events that suddenly decide to crawl out of the woodworks may also do us","6857":"The real problem, though, lies with us and the way we are

rupee coin going into a mud pot because every parent inherently believes that their purpose of life is to give their child a life better than their own","7198":"\u201cIt gives them no greater pleasure than to plait their daughter\u2019s hair and send her off to school and it makes their life worthwhile","7199":"Usually the school is the only one in that approachable perimeter","7200":"When that school is destroyed then that chance of being educated is gone","7201":"After that speech we raised $765,000 in 11 minutes flat and I didn\u2019t care if it was India or Pakistan or Guatemala \u2014 that makes no difference to me","7202":"\u201dBose quit national rugby just before the Commonwealth Games three years ago","7203":"\u201cI still play a lot of non-competitive and it is better to leave the team while you are still in it","7204":"Earlier I would look at the Indian tournaments and craft my year around them because playing the India tournaments was the most important thing in my life","7205":"Now I can prioritise","7206":"\u201d More and more actors are attaching themselves to causes","7207":"\u201cMost of them genuinely care, some enjoy the limelight,\u201d says Bose","7208":"\u201cNone of them are doing it at grassroots level because they don\u2019t have the time and whether it is a trend or coming straight from the heart, it is all fantastic effort","7209":"Even if they are doing it for publicity, it illuminates a cause that earlier didn\u2019t have the attention,\u201d said Bose","7210":"Talking about his appearance as the \u2018Global Ambassador\u2019 for Oxfam India at the recently held Violence Against Women Conference in Kathmandu, Rahul explains that every little endeavour in this world makes a difference","7211":"\u201cEven the fluttering of a butterfly\u2019s wings makes a difference","7212":"If you personify the things that beset this world like a wheel that seems to be moving everything in the direction of a disaster, then conferences, or people who write or work for these causes or the next person who puts money into Africa can all be seen as people hurling their bodies under the wheel and they seem to be getting crushed under the wheel, but the law of physics dictates that the wheel gets a tiny bit slower each time a body is hurled underneath it and one day the wheel will stop, and the next body that comes underneath it will turn it the other way","7213":"\u201cThat is when the world will stand up and say change is happening","7214":"Change could happen earlier because it has to do with the reduction of the speed of bad as much as it has to do with the increase in the speed of good","7215":"Ofcourse it looks a lot better and more obvious when good things start accelerating","7216":"\u201dOften criticised for his \u2018alternative\u2019 views on homosexuality, the infamous Delhi rape and forgiveness and reformation of criminals, Bose takes it with a pinch of salt and claims to be tremendously self-secure and thick skinned","7217":"\u201cIf we knew how much people hated us before there was Twitter and Facebook, we wouldn\u2019t even get out of bed","7218":"Now people express their hatred like they would never dare to otherwise","7219":"Even with choosing films, I am now more concerned with sleeping well at night than being ultra popular","7220":"\u201d As long as I know what I am doing and as long as I have this extraordinary ability to laugh at myself, these things don\u2019t worry me","7221":"\u201d ","7222":"Circa 1994, a young 19-year-old set up his designer-wear store in Zamzama, a commercial zone which was on the cusp of becoming Karachi\u2019s \u2018it\u2019-most shopping area","7223":"Located squarely on the main road, the logo \u2018DP\u2019 was emblazoned on the store \u2014 it quickly became a landmark that identified Zamzama as a zone for the city\u2019s most fashionable","7224":"It also became the vantage point according to which the location of other shops could be explained because, of course, everyone knew where the Deepak Perwani store was","7225":"Everyone also knew who Deepak Perwani was","7226":"He was the wild child who made fashion exciting","7227":"At a cracking pace, Deepak defined the country\u2019s quickly expanding fashion universe, moving from fashion shows to styling music videos to opening a flagship store that was frequented by the very glamorous, the rich and the famous","7228":"On the personal front, Deepak was in the front ranks of the young fashion set \u2014 a cool, clubby, creative little group who lived life in the fast lane and were at any party worth going to","7229":"\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the party, I was the \u2018it\u2019 party,\u201d Deepak smirks","7230":"Twenty six years since the opening of that fateful first store, I\u2019m meeting him for an interview, and our conversation has started off with a colourful trip down memory lane","7231":"We continue the reminiscing","7232":"Deepak, in those early glory years, was a rockstar","7233":"He\u2019d stalk into a show and cameras would veer towards him","7234":"He designed for the stars, had shops in prime locations and reveled in making politically incorrect quips","7235":"I remind him of an event where one of his fellow designers had launched a new venture with a grand dinner, inviting most of the fashion fraternity","7236":"The emcee for the night went about the room, asking the guests why they were there, and they made suitable comments","7237":"When the mike turned to Deepak, he had just shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m just here for the food","7238":"\u201dLooking at Deepak Perwani 26 years on, one often wonders whatever happened to the rockstar designer from the past","7239":"Is fashion boring him now","7240":"Or has he himself grown older, wiser, and a tad bit boring","7241":"Deepak bursts out laughing at the memory","7242":"\u201cIt was the truth, but I had said it jokingly","7243":"I do think that, as designers, sometimes we take ourselves too seriously","7244":"\u201dProfessionally, Deepak steamrollered from opening stores in mainstream locations to becoming one of the founding members of the Fashion Pakistan Council (FPC) to shows across Pakistan and around the globe","7245":"He was indelibly famous, starring in a few music videos too and even dabbling with TV dramas","7246":"It made his brand even more covetable, and life played out to a thumping, exuberant melodious beat","7247":"Deepak Perwani, the rockstar\u201cI enjoyed designing for music videos,\u201d says Deepak","7248":"\u201cNo one else but rockstars would wear pants made from Ajrak or PVC","7249":"I remember creating clothes for Junoon\u2019s world tour","7250":"The band was going to India and I made these printed jeans for Ali Azmat that were printed with the words \u2018Dil Dil Pakistan\u2019 in Hindi","7251":"I also created a Sufi look for the band","7252":"Salman Ahmed\u2019s stuck with it even now","7253":"\u201dThere were many more music videos \u2014 Deepak counts as many as 200","7254":"\u201cI worked with so many musicians \u2014 Awaz, Vital Signs, Hadiqa Kiani, Najam Sheraz","7255":"\u201d Taking me on a nostalgic journey through some of Pakistan\u2019s most prolific musical moments, he continues, \u201cThere was Khamaaj by Fuzon","7256":"Saqib Malik was directing it and Shaan was cast in the video\u2019s lead","7257":"This was at a time when his film career was downsliding, but Shaan did such a phenomenal job that his image received a complete turnaround","7258":"\u201cSaqib also directed Ali Azmat\u2019s Na Re Na and designing the wardrobe for the video was a great challenge","7259":"Tariq Amin was in charge of hair and make-up, and we wrapped up the video in Lahore over a span of seven days, filming Ali, the angels, the devil","7260":"Sometime later, I met Ali Zafar, a boy who made my sketch in the lobby of PC Bhurban, and he gave me the CD to his song","7261":"I took him to meet Tariq Amin in Lahore, and I created the wardrobe for his debut video, Channo","7262":"\u201cWe wanted to be creative and didn\u2019t obsess overselling,\u201d says Deepak","7263":"\u201cThey were exciting times for fashion, music, the field of entertainment","7264":"It was a time when we just wanted to put our ideas out there and make waves","7265":"\u201dAs opposed to now, I prod him, when fashion\u2019s furious tides seem to have simmered down to a lilting stream","7266":"The Deepak Perwani of the past would step on to the catwalk for his final bow with a skip in his step","7267":"He is laughing now as he turns back the clock to the past","7268":"He also continues to collaborate with the stars, designing wardrobes for major movies such as Jawani Phir Nahin Ani and Baaji","7269":"But there have been many more recent times, when I have seen a grumpier, drained-out side to the designer: frowning during interviews, stalking anxiously at a fashion show venue when the event is getting delayed, and inevitably shouting while managing the usual squabbles over front-row seating at a fashion week","7270":"Now when he comes out to take the bow at the end of his own show, Deepak is more likely to be smiling tiredly, as if the weight of the world were on his shoulders","7271":"Whatever happened to the rockstar designer from the past","7272":"Is fashion boring him now","7273":"Or has Deepak himself grown older, wiser, a tad bit boring","7274":"The council that drained out Deepak PerwaniThe fact that I have just asked him if he is old and boring now strikes Deepak as extremely funny","7275":"Perhaps it\u2019s the sort of description that he just isn\u2019t accustomed to","7276":"He grins and says, \u201cJust because I don\u2019t like to parade my life out on social media doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m boring","7277":"I\u2019m a private person when it comes to what I do once I\u2019m done with my work","7278":"\u201d Pausing, he adds, \u201cIf the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything it\u2019s that designers who seemed to lead the most glamorous lives have had to shut down their labels within two months of lockdown","7279":"They couldn\u2019t even sustain their businesses for a few months","7280":"The cards have come crumbling down \u2014 what you see on social media isn\u2019t always true","7281":"\u201d He then proceeds to give me a reply that I had expected: for 12 long years, he was handling the administration of the FPC in various capacities, and it wore him out","7282":"His term as Chairperson of the FPC only ended last year","7283":"\u201cFor 12 years, I would wake up every morning and fret about arranging funds for the council,\u201d he recounts","7284":"\u201cI felt this constant pressure","7285":"Since I was the one who usually arranged for sponsors, they would want to communicate with me only","7286":"At one end, I wanted to encourage new designers and, at the other end, I would be dealing with all the many demands that designers make as fashion week looms closer","7287":"I would be rushing about, dealing with everything from the seating arrangements to delays to backstage hitches","7288":"For a long time, even my offices were used by the council, for free, before it could finally afford to set up a separate space","7289":"\u201cWhen my term with the council ended, I just felt disappointed","7290":"I had given 12 years, at the very prime of my career, to this organisation, supporting and encouraging my peers and new designers","7291":"But I had been dealing with a fraternity which is extremely insecure","7292":"If I was heading a council and helping them put up their shows, then they needed to be able to listen to my constructive critique","7293":"Instead of appreciating that a veteran was giving them advice, they would assume that I was being jealous","7294":"Why would I be jealous","7295":"I was already established, and I was merely operating in my capacity as chairperson of the council","7296":"Not one of the young designers, that I had helped along the way, messaged me or called me when my term ended with the council","7297":"It was disheartening","7298":"\u201dDoes he feel relieved now, having finally left behind the messy council politics that are a sad, inevitable reality in Pakistan\u2019s fashion industry","7299":"\u201cYes, it feels great","7300":"\u201d he grins","7301":"\u201cBut even though I opted to no longer head the council, I do think that the FPC needs to rethink its structure","7302":"The council is back to square one every two to four years, when a new chairperson is elected","7303":"This just doesn\u2019t work because a longer term is needed for an individual to get things organised","7304":"The Pakistan Fashion Design Council (PFDC) in Lahore has been able to organise itself much more effectively because there is a continuity within its administration, with Sehyr Saigol permanently instated as a chairperson","7305":"\u201cThe FPC also needs to have people from business backgrounds to be part of its core team","7306":"Designers are creative people and aren\u2019t always great with numbers","7307":"So far, Feri Rawanian has been the only non-fashion CEO that the FPC has had","7308":"\u201d He goes on to quote a fellow designer, Rizwan Beyg, who had also once been part of FPC","7309":"\u201cIn the golden words of Rizwan Beyg, he told me that he had to give me credit that, after he left FPC, I had managed to institutionalise it and put in the right people","7310":"\u201dWe wanted to be creative and didn\u2019t obsess overselling,\u201d says Deepak","7311":"\u201cThey were exciting times for fashion, music, the field of entertainment","7312":"It was a time when we just wanted to put our ideas out there and make waves","7313":"\u201dThe lure of the wedding Moving away from the endless, oft-fruitless, council talk, I ask him if he truly believes that it is just council politics that have made Deepak Perwani a less adventurous man","7314":"There was a time when he would shake up the fashion industry with avant-garde design","7315":"There was the vivacious \u2018D-Philosophy\u2019 line that had made such a splash at Milan Fashion Week and then, returned to Pakistan and sold out completely","7316":"The statement circular bags were such a hit that roughshod copies of them were made by the enterprising shopkeepers in marketplaces such as Aashiana in Karachi and Liberty in Lahore","7317":"\u2018Everything But The Girl\u2019 had etched out an urbane, edgy dress code for men\u2019s suiting, the classic \u2018Amrita Shergil Collection\u2019 had floated out dreamy screen-printed fabric and \u2018Frida Goes to Kharadar\u2019 had been a tongue-in-cheek ode to the iconic Frida Kahlo","7318":"In contrast, over the past few years, Deepak\u2019s collections have been beautiful rather than full of character","7319":"His e-store right now features an extensive line-up of lehngas, ghararas and three-piece suits that have superseded the mini-dresses and gowns of yore","7320":"Like so many of his peers, Deepak has been thinking of commerce, zoning in on milking the big fat Pakistani wedding market","7321":"Revolutionary designer-wear may be great on the catwalk but no one in Pakistan, except for a very small minority, wears it","7322":"Wedding-wear and pretty three-piece suits, meanwhile, can be sold by the dozens, at considerable profits","7323":"His fine eye for design and finishing ensures that even his wedding-wear sells very well but, nevertheless, it lacks the cutting-edge streak that has always been the Deepak Perwani identity","7324":"\u201cAnything I have ever made has sold out,\u201d he smiles proudly, \u201cfrom the menswear to the wedding-wear, the pret, the luxury pret","7325":"When I was designing \u2018Frida Goes to Kharadar\u2019, my team discouraged me, telling me that no one would wear such experimental clothes","7326":"But even that collection sold out completely","7327":"\u201dHis business acumen can be credited for this as much as his designing skills","7328":"Deepak\u2019s pricing has always been very competitive, and based on his personal retail observations","7329":"\u201cWe see what\u2019s selling well, what designs can be reproduced, how many more can be sold during a sale","7330":"We offer wedding-wear at different price points","7331":"Everyone has been struggling due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic but, fortunately, because of the systems we have in place, we have been managing to break even","7332":"We have also made changes in our designs according to the requirements of our customers","7333":"More lightly embellished wedding-wear is in greater demand because people are having small-scale events","7334":"\u201dAnd even though the Covid-19 pandemic persists, he is still making plans","7335":"The 10-year anniversary celebration of his Milan Fashion Show collection is in the offing, and he is going to be turning away, momentarily, from wedding-wear\u2019s gilded cage towards funky fashion for men and women","7336":"He has been enjoying posting a \u2018century of style\u2019 series on his social media, where he is pinpointing style icons from around the world","7337":"He has just joined the boards of the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) and the National College of Arts (NCA), and is also busy resurrecting two centuries-old havelis that belong to his family, converting them into heritage sites","7338":"In the past few years, the only times I have seen Deepak truly enjoying himself have been when he is free from the shackles of fashion council duties","7339":"Three years ago, he had launched his standalone bridal studio with a mini fashion presentation, styled by longtime friend Tariq Amin","7340":"His truck-arty \u2018D-Philosophy\u2019 mannequins had taken centre-stage in the d\u00e9cor as had framed images of his shows and fashion shoots from over the years","7341":"Then, last year, he chose to fly solo on the last day of Fashion Pakistan Week, with a glamorous catwalk at a private venue, showcased for a very select guest list","7342":"Deepak had been having fun that day","7343":"\u201cSolo shows are great because they allow a designer to play up his or her strengths,\u201d Deepak tells me","7344":"\u201cNow, I don\u2019t see fashion weeks happening any time before Autumn\/Winter 2021, but I\u2019m planning a collection that may be showcased in a socially distanced, small-scale event","7345":"\u201cTwenty-six years ago, it wasn\u2019t easy for a young Hindu boy to venture out into the spotlight,\u201d he confesses","7346":"\u201cInitially, I didn\u2019t even put my name to my store, utilising just my logo","7347":"It\u2019s only now that I have the confidence, having paid my dues, to do what I want to do","7348":"\u201dI\u2019m hoping that what he wants to do is what he does best \u2014 go a little crazy, create memorable psychedelia, ruffle a few feathers, and be the rockstar that he\u2019s always been","7349":"Published in Dawn, ICON, August 9th, 2020","7350":"THE clash between Punjab police and PML-N supporters in front of the National Accountability Bureau\u2019s office in Lahore was avoidable","7351":"NAB had summoned Maryam Nawaz Sharif to appear before investigators in order to answer questions regarding \u2018illegal\u2019 acquisition of land in Raiwind","7352":"The PML-N continues to emphasise that NAB cases against the party leadership are all politically motivated","7353":"NAB for its part has not stepped back from aggressively pursuing cases against many key leaders of the party","7354":"The situation on Monday was, therefore, ripe for a confrontation","7355":"Ms Nawaz\u2019s decision to reach the bureau\u2019s offices accompanied by a large number of supporters was aimed at flexing political muscles at a time when the opposition was beginning to be seen as relatively passive","7356":"However, the behaviour of the police \u2014 which had been deployed in significant numbers armed with riot gear \u2014 further inflamed the tense situation","7357":"Video clips shared widely on social media show scenes of violence including the police hurling stones at the vehicles of PML-N leaders","7358":"The windscreen of Ms Nawaz\u2019s jeep was also damaged in the fracas","7359":"The police tear-gassing and baton charge forced NAB authorities to postpone the summons but the PML-N leader insisted in front of the media that she would stay till she had recorded her statement","7360":"Saner minds prevailed in the end and she left the venue","7361":"The police, however, arrested a number of PML-N supporters, many of whom had received injuries during the clash","7362":"The unfortunate incident once again highlighted that NAB\u2019s summoning of high-profile politicians is usually grounded more in optics than in substance","7363":"Over the last few years, dozens of politicians \u2014 an overwhelming majority belonging to the opposition \u2014 have been called for investigations, and also detained on flimsy grounds, without NAB producing any convincing case against them","7364":"Such tactics may have ensured headlines for NAB but have not led to convictions and sentences","7365":"By now, NAB authorities should have realised that the success of their performance lies less in sending high visibility summons and arrests and more in building up a case that can stand up in a court of law","7366":"The PML-N should also keep in mind that legal procedures should not be undercut for political gains","7367":"Although Ms Nawaz\u2019s defiant actions on Tuesday may have charged up the party\u2019s base, they have also contributed to politicising a valid procedural requirement from the investigating agency","7368":"For Ms Nawaz, however, the situation presented an opportunity to break her long silence and reappear in public to reinforce her defiant message","7369":"Her press conference later confirmed that her narrative has not softened","7370":"This may be a message meant both for her adversaries as well as her supporters","7371":"If the PML-N is planning to dial up pressure by getting Maryam Nawaz to return to a public role then politics is about to heat up","7372":"The fate of the opposition\u2019s multiparty conference, however, remains unclear","7373":"Published in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","7374":"WASHINGTON: The US government will pay $2","7375":"1 billion to Sanofi SA and

identical to the $40 per patient the US agreed to pay Pfizer and BioNTech SE when it inked a nearly $2 billion deal for 50 million courses of that potential vaccine last week","7379":"The Sanofi-GSK deal is for 100 million doses, at two per person, and gives the government an option to purchase an additional 500 million doses at an unspecified price","7380":"Sanofi and GSK plan to start clinical trials for the vaccine in September","7381":"Sanofi executive Clement Lewin said the companies had not yet agreed with the government on a specific price for the additional doses","7382":"GSK said in

Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists as well","7391":"Both groupings called on the government to take action against those who use social media to hurl threats, or circulate personally identifiable information of women journalists, or put into circulation doctored images designed to cause offence and attempt to humiliate them","7392":"This has become a very serious problem now, but the important thing for those using these tactics in an attempt to silence critical voices to know is that it is not only futile, but counterproductive","7393":"I have often wondered what goes through the mind of a young man (and yes, the overwhelming majority of those engaged in this sort of trolling are men) when he puts out an abusive message for a journalist","7394":"Consider this","7395":"A typical journalist, not even among the big names, can have an audience in the thousands, a medium size one will usually be communicating on a regular basis with tens of thousands, and on some big days, perhaps hundreds of thousands","7396":"The big-name TV anchors routinely communicate with an audience that is measured in the millions on a daily basis","7397":"Imagine yourself at an event speaking

reserve your attention for","7401":"The tens of thousands who are listening to you or the few hundreds who are heckling","7402":"The answer is obvious","7403":"Those who are apparently being encouraged to engage in abusive behaviour against the government\u2019s critics are searching for new ways to escalate such conduct","7404":"So watching the behaviour of this misguided youth I often wonder what they think they are accomplishing by engaging in abuse","7405":"Do they think the other party will stop, reflect, and desist from being critical of those in power due to the abuse","7406":"Do they think others who see the abuse will change their minds about the contents of the journalists\u2019 work as a result of the abuse","7407":"What exactly is the objective of using abuse as a standard language in which to engage with the work of others","7408":"Ultimately, it\u2019s futile to use abuse as a weapon in social engagements","7409":"And once those who resort to this sort of behaviour begin to tire of the futility of their efforts, they up the ante and start hunting down personal details about their target and make those public, or doctor images to put their targets\u2019 face on compromising photographs as a means of mockery","7410":"Some women journalists say photos of their faces have been photo-shopped onto pornographic images and put into circulation as a way of harassing and intimidating them","7411":"All those who have been critical of official circles have faced trolling of this sort, but women journalists are usually targeted with a particular ferocity","7412":"In their statement, the group of women journalists allege that their social media timelines are often \u201cbarraged with gender-based slurs, threats of sexual and physical violence\u201d","7413":"They go on to say that such behaviour has \u201cthe potential to incite violence and lead to hate crimes, putting our physical safety at risk\u201d","7414":"At the moment, I am not aware of many incidents where online attacks of this sort spilled over into the real world","7415":"But the large numbers of young men who are apparently being actively encouraged to engage in abusive and threatening behaviour against the critics of the government are growing increasingly frustrated, and searching for new ways to escalate their hateful conduct","7416":"If left to their own devices, it is inevitable that there will be an incident of a real-life attack by one of these random youth whose mind is too addled on the poisonous rhetoric of official circles","7417":"It is sad to note that this behaviour has been normalised from the very top","7418":"All of us vividly recall moments in the ruling party\u2019s ascension to power, for instance, when a senior party member struck Daniyal Aziz of the PML-N during a live TV show","7419":"This same corps of young men not only loudly cheered on the act, but started referring to Daniyal as \u2018Danielle\u2019, suggesting it is a woman\u2019s place to get slapped by a man","7420":"Remember the days of container politics in 2014","7421":"There was a virtually unending river of abuse that came down from the container top, and

non-payment of subsidies and a freeze on tariff by the government while consumers brave intense humid conditions","7436":"Senior official sources told Dawn that K-Electric had formally conveyed to the federal government that it was not in a position to make payments against gas and furnace oil supplies to the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO), respectively","7437":"They said a meeting of key stakeholders \u2014 Minister for Energy Omar Ayub Khan, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, Special Ass\u00adis\u00adtant to the Prime Minister on Petroleum Nadeem Babar, managements of KE and other entities and provincial representatives \u2014 reviewed the situation and felt the need for a professional handling of the situation to avert an unmanageable crisis without political considerations","7438":"Mr Babar did not respond to calls and Mr Ayub could not be reached for comments","7439":"KE chief executive Syed Moonis Alvi, however, said positive discussions had been held with the federal government and hopefully the situation was moving towards solutions","7440":"Responding to a question, he said the government should notify the tariff hike so that tariff for KE consumers and the national power tariff become equal","7441":"KE tells govt it cannot make payments to SSGCL, PSOThe non-payment of bills to SSGCL will lead to immediate closure of LNG supplies owing to a vacuum in its decision-making following fresh cases filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against the company\u2019s top management","7442":"SSGCL is currently providing about 200 million cubic feet per day of gas for 1,000MW of power generation, meaning KE\u2019s generation will drop by almost one-third","7443":"As if that is not enough, PSO is also handicapped by over Rs350 billion receivables due to circular debt of over Rs2","7444":"2 trillion and suspension of oil supplies on deferred payments by Saudi Arabia","7445":"SSGCL\u2019s outstanding bills against KE stand at about Rs14bn and are increasing at a rate of about Rs4bn per month","7446":"PSO supplies about Rs6-7bn worth of monthly fuel to KE","7447":"A KE default could spill over into public sector entities both in petroleum and power sectors","7448":"As such, the inability of KE to clear its fuel bills \u201ccould be a tipping point\u201d for the entire energy sector because public sector power companies were also operating on government support and tight cash flows, a senior official of the energy ministry said","7449":"He said the financial constraints had been part of the KE-fuel suppliers\u2019 dismal fiscal situation but aggravated by a recent decision of the federal cabinet to delay notification for about Rs2","7450":"39 per unit increase determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) which practically blocked an expected revenue stream","7451":"Based on the Nepra determination, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had in March approved an average Rs2","7452":"39 per unit increase in KE tariff to bring it on a par with uniform national power tariff","7453":"This tariff has been pending for almost three years (11 quarters)","7454":"In summers, this works out to be about Rs3bn per month that drops to about Rs2bn or averages out at about Rs2","7455":"5bn","7456":"Its application was stopped due to the Covid-19 situation at the time","7457":"The ECC again gave a go-ahead for its implementation with effect from July 1 this year, but it was again withheld by the federal cabinet and Prime Minister Imran Khan on the desire of PTI members of the cabinet from Karachi amid floods and loadshedding","7458":"The non-payment of subsidy by the government and freeze on tariff are creating cash flow problems, not only for KE but also for other distribution companies, resulting in a second-tier tariff increase to finance the borrowing costs","7459":"KE claims over Rs240bn receivables from the government, including Rs110bn on account of tariff delay and Rs32bn against the Karachi Water Board alone","7460":"While there was a dispute over whether the federal or provincial government should foot this bill, there was no disagreement that this amount was payable to KE, an official at the Governor House said","7461":"A KE official said the power utility was borrowing at almost 18 per cent mark-up to finance SSGCL\u2019s late payment surcharge and keep its other affairs running and this was again resulting in higher tariff for end consumers","7462":"For the current year, the federal government has kept Rs15bn as tariff differential subsidy in the budget for KE to keep the tariff uniform against an expected gap of Rs72bn at a rate of Rs6bn per month","7463":"Likewise, KE was paid Rs25bn as tariff subsidy during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 against its claim of Rs48-60bn","7464":"At present, the KE tariff is Rs2","7465":"89 per unit (kWh) lower than the rest of the

revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of societies that we have built","7479":"It has also exposed our falsehoods","7480":"And this is why the world needs not just climate action, but also climate justice \u2014 based on a just transition","7481":"The term \u2018just transition\u2019 is fast gaining currency in defining priorities for the implementation of the Paris Agreement","7482":"It is expected to facilitate a transition from coal and fossil fuels to alternative sources of livelihood in non-extractive industries","7483":"Initially, it was perhaps meant to \u2018buy off\u2019 trade unions and to pacify their resistance to the possible closure of their coal mines","7484":"But now the concept has begun to find deeper meaning that touches the heart of climate justice: it now stands for enabling the transition to the new climate economy (NCE) that can be built without ignoring the economic and social interests of the poor and marginalised","7485":"It is envisioned that the NCE will attract $26 trillion in investments and create 65 million new jobs over business as usual by 2030 in five key economic systems: energy, cities, food and land-use, water, and industry","7486":"This will widen inequalities even further unless imbued with a commitment to just transition","7487":"The poor everywhere in the Global South \u2014 and not just the coal miners \u2014 have already become victims of climate change","7488":"The argument is that they should not be wronged again as societies transition to climate-smart economies","7489":"The idea of a just transition is emerging as a necessary condition for effective climate action","7490":"Inspired by the South African trade unions, the argument was picked up first by the American labour movement and trade unions and then the coal-mining hubs in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia","7491":"The term \u2018just transition\u2019 has been used to advocate standards of union engagement and outcomes when moving workers from one industry to another","7492":"It is now typically combined with the elements of equity, fairness, and environmental justice particularly in the context of climate change threats","7493":"The concept now stands for the rights of labour in industry, SMEs, the informal economy and agrarian communities around the world that are coping with threats to their livelihoods","7494":"The European Union cannot expect to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050 without carrying the coal-producing rust-belt countries along","7495":"The EU has thus created a $44 billon Just Transition Fund to encourage them to leap forward to new economic sectors by retooling, reskilling and upskilling coal miners and boosting local economies","7496":"This is in addition to an EU-wide $825bn green stimulus package to support a) building efficiency, b) clean technology investment, c) low-carbon vehicles, and d) food and agricultural land","7497":"This will, in effect, weaken and neutralise opposition to the climate transition and make the EU more competitive in the global marketplace, while meeting the Paris Agreement","7498":"In the Paris Agreement, a commitment is made to take into account \u201cthe imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities\u201d","7499":"This commitment was further strengthened through a Just Transition Declaration at COP 24 in 2018, in Katowice, Poland","7500":"Several countries have since begun to incorporate the concept, tools and processes of \u2018just transition\u2019 in their development plans and particularly in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that provide road maps for their climate actions","7501":"Concurrently, the need is growing to develop concrete tools and strategies, especially since the Paris Agreement and NDCs require countries to submit ambitiously revised targets and action plans before the 26th climate summit in Glasgow in 2021","7502":"In other words, the idea of a just transition is emerging as a necessary condition for effective climate action in climate negotiations","7503":"Is a just transition relevant to Pakistan and other developing countries","7504":"How can we help broaden the contours of the debate by questioning its myopic Eurocentric preoccupation","7505":"Sneaked in the thick texts of the Paris Agreement, most developing country delegates underestimated its potential significance during negotiations","7506":"Thankfully, scores of think tanks like IIED, WRI, CSI, SEI and others have since then pushed the conceptual boundaries for it to include such concerns as land-use planning, ecosystem-based natural resource management, land degradation neutrality \u2014 concepts of immediate relevance to the Global South including Pakistan","7507":"The principle of shared but differentiated responsibility that had been diluted, if not buried over the years, is now being resuscitated as the basis for a just transition","7508":"There is an emerging realisation that without climate justice embedded in just transition, transformational change cannot take place","7509":"The climate discourse has mostly been middle-class driven and its ideals have not shown sufficient sensitivity to climate justice and the hardships the NCE would entail for the poor","7510":"By way of example, Pakistan is making elaborate plans to introduce electronic vehicles","7511":"Why, instead of focusing on middle-class automobiles, can a just transition for rickshaw drivers not be prioritised, together with two-wheelers, and commercial transporters","7512":"Bottom line","7513":"Rethink and ensure that the transition to NCE does not further squeeze the poor","7514":"Pakistan has announced an elaborate portfolio of climate actions that can still be meaningfully aligned with principles of a just transition","7515":"For a start, Pakistan can engage in this global conversation by embedding just transition and NCE concepts into the National Climate Change Policy and NDCs","7516":"At present, both documents are being revised and they can potentially show our national commitment to climate justice","7517":"Second, Pakistan\u2019s funding requests to Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, Global Environment Facility and others can be based on the principles of just transition","7518":"For this, Pakistan will need to closely work with the accredited agencies or intermediary organisations who typically develop projects on Pakistan\u2019s behalf","7519":"The World Bank managed Climate Investment Funds have

events \u2014 there were four of them when I last counted\u2014 set to showcase the latest seasonal trends could take place","7975":"And those of us used to scheduling our lives around the yearly annual fashion calendar, did miss the catwalk; it seems absence does make the heart grow fonder","7976":"We missed the buzz, which may have been hard to find in recent times but would still sometimes simmer onto the surface, on particular days, during particular shows","7977":"We missed the fashion on the catwalk and off it and the opportunity to meet with the fraternity, for three or four days in a row","7978":"We also missed the excuse to get dressed up, slip into our high heels and go out for the night","7979":"Of course, how could we not miss the behind the scenes gossip which always runs so rampantly at fashion events and is often talked about much more than the fashion itself","7980":"Read: Who will help Pakistan's fashion industry","7981":"As a fashion critic, I personally missed pulling all-nighters, assisted by big cups of coffee, reviewing one show after the other","7982":"While writing about the more ghastly collections is never enjoyable, there is a certain high that I get when I wax lyrical about clothes that are utterly beautiful, a show that is standout or a brilliant new designer who has all the makings of becoming the next big thing","7983":"And yet, there\u2019s a catch to missing fashion week","7984":"It\u2019s no secret that the Pakistani fashion event rigmarole has become exhausting and very, very tedious","7985":"While I wish that the coronavirus ends soon and we\u2019re back to sitting side by side, gazing at the catwalk, one day after the other, there is also honestly so much that I don\u2019t miss\u2026","7986":"This one\u2019s a no-brainer","7987":"One of the most irritating aspects of attending a fashion week is that the show, officially supposed to start at a sedate \u20186","7988":"30 p","7989":"m","7990":"\u2019 almost always begins two or three hours later","7991":"There are usually six to eight (if not more) designer shows scheduled for a day and this means that the event only wraps up around 11 p","7992":"m","7993":"The last day of a fashion week is an exception","7994":"The final show of the event, also known as the \u2018grand finale\u2019, is only able to bring on its grandeur around midnight, or even later","7995":"By this time, the eyes are getting bleary and a slight headache is threatening to take over","7996":"A local fashion week choreographer once quipped when the media complained about the late hours, telling them that they weren\u2019t turning into vegetables after midnight","7997":"The Cinderella-esque reference is quite funny because one does feel like a slowly vegetating pumpkin as the clock ticks on","7998":"The mind gets numb and fashion fatigue kicks in","7999":"Most critics will tell you that even if the final show is exceptional, it loses much of its impact because the audience is so tired by then","8000":"There was a time when fashion councils had taken note of these cribs and an effort was being made to wrap up a show by 10 p","8001":"m","8002":"But \u2014except for HUM Showcase which is not a fashion week but a couture based show that has so far always been very timely\u2014 these developments were short-lived and recent fashion weeks have all only come to an end late into the night","8003":"It\u2019s no wonder, then, that \u2018fashion week survival kits\u2019, often given in the form of goody bags to the audience, include aspirin, as an acknowledgement of the pain that an extensively delayed event can induce","8004":"And here\u2019s a thought: perhaps the coronavirus can act as a wake-up call for fashion weeks to sort out their organizational problems","8005":"In an effort to follow international fashion schedules, local fashion weeks could try to switch to day time timings or at least, early evening hours","8006":"That\u2019s how it\u2019s done in the rest of the world","8007":"Nowhere else, except in Pakistan, are people expected to attend a work-based event long after midnight","8008":"Everyone wants to sit in the front row","8009":"They fight with the PR, advocating why they deserve to be seated right up front","8010":"Sometimes, they just persistently somehow squeeze themselves onto front row seats, perched precariously between friends","8011":"Even though they may have no work to do at fashion week and could simply see the show from a back-row, sitting anywhere else would administer an indelible blow to their egos","8012":"The PR itself is often up to its own machinations, devising unfair seating arrangements: their friends who are merely there for the \u2018experience\u2019 somehow end up sitting in the front, critics and bloggers whose work requires them to cover the event in detail could get relegated to the back","8013":"Some people find the front row tussles entertaining but ultimately, they are disconcerting, especially for people who look upon fashion weeks as business-centric events","8014":"It\u2019s not a show, created for entertainment","8015":"Designers are not in the business of making spectacles that merely provide glamorous backdrops for people wanting to take selfies from the front row","8016":"Heavy investments are made into a fashion week showcase, in creating a collection as well as paying participation fees to the fashion council","8017":"Front row fights that tend to ensue right before the first show make fashion weeks look petty, as if they are merely putting out shows for entertainment rather than pushing forward the business of fashion","8018":"There was a time, so long ago that one has to try hard to remember it, when fashion week attendance was restricted to a select, exclusive niche","8019":"These were people who were genuinely interested in designer-wear and often brought business to local brands","8020":"When they would crane their neck to scrutinize an outfit or applaud after a show, it would have been because they had truly liked a collection","8021":"\u2018It\u2019 celebrities would also attend the event, seated in the front row, supporting their favourite brands","8022":"Fast-forwarding to present day, the audience claps when they see a celebrity as a showstopper on the runway","8023":"It doesn\u2019t matter if the celebrity is wearing the most ghastly clothes; that\u2019s just when the cellphone cameras get clicking and the applause rolls in","8024":"And the unwanted riffraff that manages to somehow secure seats in the second and third rows, happily crane their necks at the catwalk, assuming that fashion weeks have been devised to simply serve the purpose of allowing them to freely ogle models","8025":"Somehow, this crowd has become an inevitable reality at any local fashion week, wheedling their way in through passes given out by sponsors","8026":"They won\u2019t mind pushing you as you weave your way through the crowded entrance","8027":"And don\u2019t be surprised if they wink or blow kisses at you from their vantage point, seated across from you","8028":"Yes, that does happen","8029":"All the time","8030":"It is only rare, and usually at solo shows, that crowd control ceases to be a problem","8031":"The select crowd and the stars return, cheering a great collection, adding exclusivity at an event","8032":"The fashion can be very, very bad","8033":"There are always high points to a fashion week, stellar collections that are always remembered over the years","8034":"Sometimes, there\u2019s a single day at fashion week where several designers showcase exceptional works","8035":"There have been times when young designers have debuted and proven their mettle with innovative new ideas","8036":"These are the collections that make you clap, click away on your cellphone camera and acknowledge that yes, this is what fashion week is all about","8037":"But over the years, these days have become rare","8038":"Outnumbering the good collections are the mediocre ones","8039":"Rearing their heads every now and then are truly ghastly clothes","8040":"Copycat fashion, plagiarized right off another designer\u2019s collection, is frequent","8041":"It\u2019s quite common for sequins to scatter on to the runway or threads to run loose","8042":"It seems that anyone and everyone can be part of the event as long as they are willing to pay the hefty participation fees","8043":"Less fashion weeks will mean that fewer brands \n  will be able to show","8044":"The better ones can get selected \n  while mediocre brands can try their luck again, next time","8045":"The copycats could be rejected altogether","8046":"The badly finished \n  collections could be skipped out","8047":"Even some of fashion\u2019s longest-standing, most prestigious names have often been unable to impress","8048":"Pakistani consumers don\u2019t usually invest heavily in experimental clothes","8049":"They prefer pretty colour palettes and embroideries on safe, easy-to-wear silhouettes","8050":"In the past, designers would showcase more avant-garde work on the catwalk and then, simplify it for commercial retail","8051":"Now, with so much competition in the market \u2014and copycats running unhindered\u2014 customers have become more fickle","8052":"It seems as if designers prefer to use the catwalk as a catalogue, showcasing wearable, pretty (but forgettable) clothes that can be ordered, as is","8053":"It makes for some very boring fashion weeks","8054":"Not really the sort of stuff that you\u2019d miss","8055":"And this, precisely, is why there are certain things that one doesn\u2019t miss about fashion weeks","8056":"The generic collections, the mediocrity and the general predilection for treating fashion as entertainment wouldn\u2019t be there if there were fewer fashion weeks","8057":"Both Karachi and Lahore have their own slew of events and \u2014this could be wishful thinking\u2014 the economic crunch administered by the coronavirus may be the impetus that both cities\u2019 fashion councils need to finally start working together","8058":"Less fashion weeks will mean that fewer brands will be able to show","8059":"The better ones can get selected while mediocre brands can try their luck again, next time","8060":"The copycats could be rejected altogether","8061":"The badly finished collections could be skipped out","8062":"And if high fashion is seen more frequently on the catwalk, it can drive other brands to aspire towards similar standards","8063":"Fewer fashion weeks but better ones would be the way forward, steering the industry towards more refined aesthetics","8064":"But will the post Covid world bring in a new, better era for local fashion","8065":"Or will it continue stagnating on catwalks where anything goes and the hours stretch on, smothered in pastel-coloured, sequin infested, same-looking clouds of fabric","8066":"Will designers and design councils manage to look beyond their egos and realize all that they have been doing wrong and work harder towards creating an authentic, exciting design","8067":"In truth, designer egos, their frequent clashes and their obstinate refusal to look at how their penchant for commercialism and mediocrity has been diminishing the very essence of Pakistani fashion \u2026 that\u2019s also something that I don\u2019t miss","8068":"MELBOURNE: Hopes that Australia

certainty\u201d that any rollback of restrictions would see cases spiral out of control, he said","8080":"The resurgence of the virus has been largely blamed on security bungles at hotels used to quarantine international travellers that allowed Covid-19 to leak into the community","8081":"But Andrews also blamed the continuing rise in cases on those flouting the rules \u2014 including people with the virus leaving their homes instead of quarantining for 14 days","8082":"A quarter of those doorknocked by inspections staff on Thursday were absent","8083":"\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible

Salman Butt (1990-93), it remains practically unchanged for the last 73 years","8130":"Departments rule the roost and teams include the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), the Karachi Port Trust (KPT), the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), the Pakistan Army and other government entities, which use investment in sports as evidence of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), with little desire to develop talent or professionalise their set-ups","8131":"The few clubs that are present are primarily from Balochistan, where the fierce Chaman derby between Afghan FC and Muslim FC commands crowds in the thousands","8132":"Most of the league, though, is played silently, without any fanfare","8133":"Player development, proper infrastructure, funding, facilities for talent at the grassroots level and clubs are the pillars on which countries have built soccer powerhouses","8134":"How can Pakistan at least get started","8135":"The entire system reeks of the Soviet Union era, where sports were essentially represented by various government entities competing against each other and offering jobs to athletes","8136":"The world moved on","8137":"Even state departments such as CSKA (Russian Army) and Lokomotiv (Railways) Moscow have become huge brands in their own right","8138":"But Pakistan has stayed put","8139":"In 2007, a breath of fresh air arrived in the shape of the Geo Super League, with teams based on cities and live broadcast of all the games","8140":"It gave live coverage to domestic footballers for the first time and merited a second attempt in partnership with K-Electric in 2010","8141":"But the league did not continue because the organisers and sponsors reportedly did not want to work with the PFF again","8142":"Subsequently, the Pakistan Premier League (PPL) has never bagged a regular sponsor (a five-year-deal with KASB fell through after a single season in 2009), runs on an ad-hoc basis for four to five months, and has never been broadcast on television","8143":"You needn\u2019t look far for inspiration","8144":"Bangladesh, after their independence in 1971, has managed to professionalise legacy football clubs and mould them into the Bangladesh Premier League, where historical names such as Dhaka Mohammaden, Sheikh Russell and Sheikh Jamal are at home with newcomers such as Bashundhara Kings, who earned their first title in 2019","8145":"A corporate-owned team by a real estate group, the Bashundhara team has now turned their attention to the Bashundhara Sports Complex, which will be one of the first private sports infrastructure projects in the country, and can go a long way in developing grassroots talent and building up a sports eco-system","8146":"Such success stories were made possible because the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has consistently managed to rope in sponsors such as TVS and Grameenphone, while the games are shown live across multiple channels, with the latest being Bangla TV","8147":"On the other hand, our feisty rival, India, isn\u2019t even our competition in terms of local progress","8148":"They are so far ahead in terms of their league development that the distance could be measured in decades","8149":"The Indian Super League (ISL), since its inception in 2014, has managed to capture the imagination of the public, bring hefty sponsorships into the game and produce a quality football broadcast that hasn\u2019t been seen before in South Asia","8150":"But it too has had its fair share of problems","8151":"The ISL was thrust to the top of the Indian football pyramid just when the I-League (the old top tier in India) had started a revamping process with new, privately owned clubs","8152":"This led to massive differences with legacy institutions such as Mohun Bagan and East Bengal (the Kolkata derby between the two still attracts over 120,000 spectators), while others such as Pune FC and Minerva Punjab disbanded due to the ongoing tussle","8153":"This brings us to the key question: what should Pakistan\u2019s league look like","8154":"Should it be a franchise-based model like the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in cricket, or should it take a route similar to Bangladesh\u2019s","8155":"The answer is strategic and is based on the fact that Pakistan, unlike Bangladesh and India, does not have a strong football culture or legacy clubs \u2014 even the best players from historic hotspots Chaman and Lyari plied their trade in Kolkata and Dhaka before independence","8156":"This means that club culture needs to be created from scratch","8157":"However, a PSL-like franchise system will not do","8158":"Since a PSL team is extremely expensive ($6","8159":"2 million per year for Multan Sultans, for example) and while football will be cheaper, it is crucial that the money be spent on football and infrastructure development rather than paying team costs","8160":"An alternative route is revamping the PPL with an immediate phasing out of departmental teams and their replacement with city-based teams that can be acquired through one-off payments or low franchise fees with long-term installment plans","8161":"Most of the club identities would be freshly created in this scenario, but existing clubs including the two Chaman favourites, Baloch FC Nushki and even the well-run Karachi United can be used as vehicles for investment, and be given a chance to organically expand their fan-base","8162":"This approach allows for the marketing and hype associated with a franchise model but also prevents a completely new league from being at odds with the football pyramid","8163":"As a result, the entire system, including a second tier league and below, can be remodeled to ensure promotion and relegation, a fundamental principle of global football that the franchise model ignores","8164":"Even more important is ensuring that a league is indeed a league","8165":"What the ISL in India faced was its existence as a mere tournament in the books of FIFA and AFC, and thus it had to endure a long battle to attain top tier status as competition to the I-League","8166":"A revamped PPL will have no such problems, and allow it to qualify for the AFC Cup League criteria where Pakistan currently receives the lowest possible allowance","8167":"Pakistan has to start from the lowest level in that, a pre-playoff place in Asia\u2019s second tier continental competition","8168":"Meeting requirements for the AFC Cup will require organic growth from clubs and the league, but the long-term aim should be qualification for the AFC Champions League (Asia\u2019s equivalent of the UEFA Champions League)","8169":"This requires a host of features, including 14-15 teams in a league, 27 minimum games for each side and a maximum of two teams sharing a single stadium","8170":"The list is extensive, covering everything from ticket pricing to club administration","8171":"It\u2019s a lofty dream, but one which can be achieved with the right vision and strategic planning","8172":"A football league is a certainty in Pakistan in the next few years and the PFF recently made it clear that they hold the rights to such a venture, not any third party","8173":"However, for Pakistan to truly realise its potential, what\u2019s needed is harmony between the private sector and the federation","8174":"Most importantly, it needs to have a league model, where the priority is football","8175":"The writer tweets

generation should learn to admit our own mistakes","8188":"Here I will suggest a way out to the youth who are the ones most in need of support and encouragement","8189":"What must be remembered is that there were some freedoms we were expecting when Pakistan was created","8190":"I will mention them briefly: 1) freedom of thought and expression which the British had not allowed (remember Jallianwala) and we believed we would get; 2) freedom of worship for all faiths (that was promised by the Quaid-i-Azam in his Aug 11, 1947, speech to the Constituent Assembly); 3) freedom from exploitation, a process that colonisation is historically notorious for","8191":"Aug 14 is an occasion to introspect, especially for the youth\u2019s sake","8192":"Unfortunately, we have never been granted these","8193":"You will agree if you look at the clampdown on the media \u2014 sometimes less and sometimes more but always there \u2014 and the blatant efforts made from time to time to turn Pakistan into a theocratic state, something that would inevitably result in discrimination against the non-Muslims and the minority Muslim sects","8194":"As for exploitation, one has to see the marginalisation of nearly 60 per cent (the figure might be greater now) of the population that lives below the poverty line and is denied its socioeconomic rights, leaving them with a \u201cnasty,

our only salvation","8199":"But it has always been devalued from the start so much that it has hit rock bottom today","8200":"Now the Single National Curriculum that is to be foisted on us has robbed us of this hope as well","8201":"It amounts to a planned decimation of education in Pakistan","8202":"The SNC will pave the way for theocracy","8203":"It will encourage memorisation rather than critical thinking","8204":"We obviously cannot create our own education system to neutralise the indoctrination our students are subjected to","8205":"The public sector dominates all levels of education","8206":"As for the mid-level private sector, it is controlled by a handful of donors who avoid all confrontation","8207":"That is also the case with powerful elite private institutions","8208":"If they resist the government\u2019s moves they will lose the privileges they enjoy as a quid pro quo for not disturbing the peace","8209":"Hence one cannot expect any resistance from them","8210":"We still have a way out","8211":"Informal education","8212":"Some NGOs are already doing it","8213":"They hold lectures and workshops on issues which no university here touches with a barge pole","8214":"One of them is the HRCP","8215":"There are others too playing a similar role but as they do not have as much clout I will not name them for their own safety","8216":"If the audience is young it learns of other perspectives which are taboo at our universities","8217":"That provokes the youth to think and question","8218":"Of course, the youth could have learnt more from books","8219":"But we do not have a reading culture and the government is not helping by ruthlessly banning books","8220":"Such organisations are, however, too small in number to make an impact","8221":"What we need are informal study circles","8222":"Even if small in size, such circles should meet regularly to provide the youth a platform to express their views in discourses on issues of public interest","8223":"Once started, this phenomenon would snowball if managed with discretion and tolerance","8224":"Participation of intellectuals and leaders of opinion periodically should encourage the youth and keep interest alive","8225":"Another idea worth exploring is that of starting small centres with communication equipment to screen documentaries and videos on issues that are shirked by the formal education sector","8226":"The smaller and more informal these groups the more likely they are to survive and mushroom","8227":"Above all, their strength will lie in

ruined","8267":"All the time we feel sleepy and lazy, but for staying healthy and relaxed, we need to indulge in different beneficial activities","8268":"And among the activities, reading books is very beneficial for us because books are a uniquely portable magic","8269":"I am fond of books and reading books is my favourite hobby","8270":"I have read many books, but amongst them here are my top five favourite books that I would suggest to you to read","8271":"Charlie And The Chocolate FactoryThe book which I love the most is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, written by my favourite author, Roald Dahl","8272":"The story revolves around a poor family of a little boy named Charlie, who is fond of chocolates and even more than that, he wishes to visit Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory","8273":"The book is about five little children who become the lucky ones to get a chance to visit Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory and as each page of the novel is turned, it becomes more and more interesting","8274":"Great ExpectationsGreat Expectations is written by Charles Dickens and this is one of his most famous books","8275":"This book narrates the story of Pip, an orphan boy

is always helpful","8324":"Make sure to have antibacterial wipes and sanitizers on you when going out to dine, and avoid touching doors and furniture unnecessarily with hands","8325":"In Paris, stuffed teddy bears are put on chairs to ensure social distancing and if I were going out, I\u2019d definitely take my own teddy with me - but hey, the point is to be careful and know that your safety

more and more people (not just brands) have become content creators and are building audiences thanks to easy-to-use apps such as TikTok, YouTube and more","8477":"Yet, despite this saturated mix, many pieces of content have managed to stand out and make an impact, leaving many marketers wishing they could put their brands in the limelight in this way","8478":"So the question is what makes some content \u2018viral\u2019, while others, created with the very purpose of achieving virality, fail","8479":"Before we ponder this question, let\u2019s define \u2018virality\u2019: it is when a piece of content circulates rapidly and widely from one web user to another","8480":"In marketing jargon, it is when content organically garners high engagement, mentions and widespread awareness, while instantly achieving Top-of-Mind","8481":"Much like a virus","8482":"In about 350 BCE, Aristotle wanted to write a speech and he thought about what would make it both memorable and persuasive","8483":"He wanted people to pass the idea on to others and form a kind of chain reaction","8484":"In today\u2019s world, this is equivalent to a re-tweet or clicking a share button","8485":"In this endeavour, Aristotle identified three principles: ethos (that which possess ethical appeal); pathos (that which appeals to the emotions) and logos (that which contains logical appeal)","8486":"He also stressed that in each case the message had to be impactful","8487":"The same is true today","8488":"If virality is the objective, the content must be developed in a highly relatable way and strongly evoke human emotion \u2013 whether it\u2019s pleasure, laughter, empathy or even shock","8489":"This is one of the reasons why people share cat videos; they are heart-warming and pleasing to watch","8490":"Content has to be positive and have a bigger takeaway than (for example) encouraging people to buy a brand of ceiling fan","8491":"Another important factor to consider when developing viral content, is what is in it for the audience","8492":"Think about why anyone would share a piece of information","8493":"For example, people like to share a laugh with their friends and family (which is why people prefer to share something like \u2018aam khaayega aam\u2019, or \u2018yeh gormint bik gai hai\u2019, rather than a song- and-dance routine)","8494":"The UN Women Pakistan\u2019s Child Bride campaign went viral because of its shock-effect; the recent resurfacing of the Servis shoes commercial shows how much people enjoyed the original jingle","8495":"The key takeaway is that brands on their own can never become viral, they must connect with the audience on a deeper level through the use of different creative elements","8496":"It is not uncommon for clients to ask for campaigns that go viral, without really understanding what this entails \u2013 especially when they want the product to become the hero of the campaign","8497":"For many brand managers achieving virality may be a goal, but does it really substantiate something for the brand or the business in the long run","8498":"Imagine that a bank wants to launch a campaign to promote a financial service and decides it should go viral in order to build widespread awareness","8499":"In this case, every idea will be scrutinised from the point of view of its potential to go viral","8500":"If the product is a dry financial service (and needs to be to focal point of the campaign) how likely is it that audiences will share the content far and wide","8501":"Going viral should not be an end in itself; it must meet the brand and business objectives","8502":"Let\u2019s face it, no matter how good a campaign you develop, nobody can predict how viral it may become - audience response is always organic in the case of viral content","8503":"Many brands use other techniques to achieve virality, but often fall flat on their faces\u2013 such as using trend-jacking techniques","8504":"Piggybacking the brand on an ongoing conversation may get it noticed, but will the brand message register in the minds of the target audience","8505":"Another example is when brands partner with content creators to integrate their products","8506":"Even if this content manages to go viral, is it because of the brand, or the nature of the content itself","8507":"Ufone\u2019s Teri Mehrbaani commercial was an instant hit because people remembered it for the tongue-in-cheek humour, while the notion of voice clarity was subtly embedded in the concept","8508":"As long as the concept integrates seamlessly with the brand while remaining insightful and relatable to human emotions and experiences, virality can always be achieved","8509":"Finally here are some tips if you want to create content with the potential to go viral: 1","8510":"Think about how going viral will help you achieve your objective","8511":"2","8512":"Look for insights","8513":"3","8514":"Put the idea first and the product after","8515":"4","8516":"Use hashtags","8517":"5","8518":"Humanise the

Advocate General of Sindh Salman Talibuddin seeking modification of its Wednesday\u2019s order regarding cleaning of all drains through the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)","8542":"He contended that the provincial authorities undertook the work of cleaning drains of the city and around 50pc cleaning of Gujjar Nullah was done before the NDMA took over on Aug 3","8543":"He argued that the NDMA was desilting three main drains and the provincial authorities be allowed to clean the remaining drains which would be completed by Aug 30 since he claimed that they had already done a lot of work on such drains","8544":"The provincial law officer further maintained that the project was funded by the World Bank and the court had given its ownership to the NDMA","8545":"He further argued that the machinery and manpower of the provincial government were being used and the NDMA was supervising the work","8546":"Justice Ahsan reminded the provincial law officer that he didn\u2019t say a single word against it when the bench passed the order on Wednesday","8547":"The chief justice asked him why these drains were choked and overflowed during recent rains and said that they will not amend the order","8548":"He further remarked that in fact the motive for the provincial authorities was something else as they were concerned about the funds provided by the World Bank since the provincial government had to brief the Bank about utilisation of funds","8549":"EncroachmentsThe bench issued notices to the commissioner of Karachi, director general of Karachi Development Authority,

next month","8594":"Fawad is too ugly\/unconventional a player for Misbah and his band of purists to take a risk on","8595":"ON July 29, Narendra Modi\u2019s government unveiled what it calls a groundbreaking new national education policy (NEP 2020)","8596":"The 65-page document\u2019s wide range \u2014 from primary to university \u2014 forces me to consider here just a single issue: To what extent does NEP reflect the BJP ideology of Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan","8597":"And how does it compare against Pakistan\u2019s newly declared single national curriculum with logo: one nation, one curriculum","8598":"At face value NEP is innocuous, even charming","8599":"It speaks of India\u2019s rich heritage, the ancient universities of Nalanda and Takshashila, mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya and Brahmagupta, jnan (knowledge) and satya (truth) etc","8600":"The goal of education is: \u201ccomplete realisation and liberation of the self\u201d","8601":"Who can possibly object","8602":"Still better: my computer word search yielded only two occurrences of the word \u2018religion\u2019, both times in the harmless context of NEP\u2019s purported inclusion of all religions","8603":"NEP also engages our anti-colonial sensibilities: Indian children up to grade 6-7 can learn English if they want but, under its new three-language formula, states and regions can choose their languages provided at least two of the three are native to India","8604":"In principle Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, and Christian students will use the same books, study side by side in the same classrooms, and take the same exams","8605":"Wonderful","8606":"But inside NEP\u2019s not-so-hidden agenda are the clear wishes of RSS, the BJP\u2019s ideological parent","8607":"RSS follows its guru, M","8608":"S","8609":"Golwalkar, who suggested India learn from Hitler in keeping races pure","8610":"In 1947, RSS wanted all Muslims remaining in India expelled to Pakistan","8611":"Then a minority, it now enjoys full state support","8612":"India must look towards its glorious past, declares NEP, with that past exclusively Hindu","8613":"Although Sanskrit is a culturally dead language, NEP calls it the fount of all sacred and secular knowledge","8614":"Urdu, on the other hand, although spoken by tens of millions of Indians and once the language of the Bombay film industry, is absent from a list that includes Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Pali, Persian, and Prakrit","8615":"India and Pakistan\u2019s new education policies will push their respective religious minorities into a cornerAll education policies are cooking recipes; the final product depends upon ingredients","8616":"NEP hints at, but leaves unspecified, what textbooks will contain","8617":"Will history be dispassionately presented as a series of invasions which, layer by layer, built Indian culture over the millennia","8618":"Or are Muslims merely wicked temple-destroyers who shattered the seraphic heaven of Mother India","8619":"One worries because in BJP-ruled states, leaders have demanded removal of references to Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb to make space for Hindu kings like Maharana Pratap and Shivaji","8620":"Interestingly, RSS\u2019s nativism appears driven more by its anti-Christian agenda than its anti-Muslim one","8621":"Since the days of Lord Macaulay, convents and other English-medium Christian missionary schools have been the mainstay of modern Indian education","8622":"But today, tens of thousands of RSS-associated vernacular language schools stand against them","8623":"These will gain from downgrading English","8624":"RSS pracharaks are jubilant but Indians face a reality check","8625":"English-medium schools, not traditional patshalas and gurukuls, modernised India and gave it global clout","8626":"While India can name its satellite \u2018Aryabhatta\u2019, Isaac Newton\u2019s laws actually guided it into orbit","8627":"Even the BJP minister whose signature is on NEP, Prakash Javedekar, knows this","8628":"From Indian press reports I found that he, along with nine other BJP ministers, has also sent his children to study abroad","8629":"NEP is a step backward for India\u2019s national integration","8630":"In spite of 30 languages, 130 dialects, and well over a dozen faiths, India took barely 50 years to create a national identity after Jawaharlal Nehru set it on a secular track","8631":"Most Muslims, Sikhs and Christians were then proud to declare themselves Indian","8632":"But, as Indian secularism retreats, this is now disappearing","8633":"Pakistan\u2019s new education policy, only parts of which are known so far, is much more upfront on creating a religion-based society","8634":"The goal is to put madressahs at the same level as all other kinds of schools","8635":"Henceforth, bearded men from the Ittehad Tanzimat-i-Madaris (Coalition of Madressah Organisers) will decide what Pakistani children will learn and will also scrutinise their textbooks","8636":"Religious materials are mandatory from nursery classes onward","8637":"The new Class 1-5 curriculum is extremely detailed and reveals more religious content to be memorised than even madressahs require","8638":"Discrimination is automatic","8639":"Since non-Muslim students cannot be allowed to study from the Holy Book, they must be separated","8640":"Major changes are afoot at higher levels as well","8641":"The governor of Punjab, Ghulam Sarwar, told me during an exclusive one-on-one meeting in his office on July 23 of his decision to make the award of all university degrees in Punjab contingent upon studying the Holy Quran together with translation","8642":"Doing so, he said, will ensure that our university students learn Arabic","8643":"He did not elaborate on how this would help make better doctors, economists, engineers, or scientists","8644":"For building national identity Pakistan seeks to Arabicise and Islamise whereas India wants to indigenise and Hinduise","8645":"The BJP\u2019s way is more subtle than Pakistan\u2019s but cleverer because it understands the enormous power of culture","8646":"Programmes such as \u2018Aik Bharat Shreshtha Bharat\u2019 aim at developing a multilingual, multicultural (but not multi-religious) Indian national identity","8647":"Compare that with education policies in Pakistan where regional cultures and languages find only fleeting references","8648":"With no lessons learnt from 1971, Pakistan still assumes that solidifying its Islamic identity will somehow create national integration","8649":"Even something as mild as the 18th Amendment, which entrusts education to the provinces, has the sword of Damocles hanging over it","8650":"The new education policies of India and Pakistan will further divide them, both from each other as well as within each country","8651":"Majoritarian consensus against their respective religious minorities will be hugely strengthened","8652":"The Indian policy is milder in tone than Pakistan\u2019s but is probably more dangerous simply because it is better thought out and professionally formulated, hence, likely to be more successful when implemented","8653":"On the other hand, the Pakistani policy document is half-baked, wrapped in multiple layers of confusion, and will almost certainly flounder","8654":"But if it is implemented, it will lead to fasaadi extremism of a kind that operations like Radul Fasaad cannot ever defeat","8655":"The writer teaches physics

investigated","8687":"Action, the military\u2019s media affairs wing said, was also being taken against those found guilty of violating the official standard operating procedures (SOPs) on cyber

technical gadgets of govt officials and military personnelAPT is defined as a long-term intrusion normally by a state-sponsored actor into network\/s in order to mine highly sensitive

gathering and credential theft for follow-on operations","8694":"He said that the adversaries targeting Pakistan specifically went after government officials, diplomats and businessmen","8695":"APT groups, he wrote, mostly used simple, freely available malware that heavily relied on phishing campaigns","8696":"Talking to Dawn on Wednesday over phone, Mr Naiyer said that although not much had so

fraternity","8707":"With little patronage to compete for and minimal ideological divide, the desire for rhyming ripostes and public put-downs hardly exists","8708":"It wasn\u2019t always so","8709":"Previously poets were often rivals and lost no opportunity in exchanging barbs couched in deadly but exquisite eloquence","8710":"Muhammed Ibrahim Zauq and Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan, better known as Ghalib, were bitter rivals, for example, and unleashed several lyrical fusillades against each other to win Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2019s favours","8711":"From the days of Ghalib, mushairas (poetry recitals) were not just a platform for dissent against the state, but also opportunities to protest against other members of the poetic community to highlight ideological differences","8712":"Among the more recent examples of such poetic friction was the Bayaad-i-Josh mushaira held on April 13, 1982","8713":"Organised by the Anjuman-i-Saadat-i-Amroha at a time of great censorship because of Gen Zia\u2019s dictatorial regime, it was a memorial for Josh Malihabadi, whose death on February 22, 1982 had been ignored by the state","8714":"Members of the Amrohvi community in Karachi had the intellectual gravitas to brave the political backlash","8715":"The event featured some of the greatest Urdu poets of the time, who were witness to an episode that highlighted the ideological differences of Josh Malihabadi and Hafeez Jalandhari, one a fierce critic of dictators and the other a close supporter","8716":"Josh Malihabadi had immigrated to Pakistan several years after Partition and was never at ease in his new country","8717":"He had been a part of India\u2019s intellectual elite, and a darling of the Congress leadership","8718":"So iconic was Josh in India that Vijay, the protagonist from Guru Dutt\u2019s cult classic Pyaasa, wants to be a revolutionary poet just like Josh","8719":"Vijay snubs the more populist genre of romantic poetry, for which he suffers great hardship","8720":"Despite his position in India, Josh gave in to the entreaties of A","8721":"T","8722":"Naqvi, commissioner of Karachi, who had told him, \u201cJosh Sahib, you

countries, Josh left India thinking that Urdu would be ignored there because of the \u201cnarrow-minded nationalism of Hindus","8724":"\u201d In 1955, he crossed the border and, soon after, became a fierce critic of the military dictatorship of Ayub Khan","8725":"For this he faced endless problems, becoming the target of right-wingers while his property was confiscated by the regime","8726":"His poetry too did not get the requisite recognition from the state","8727":"Josh Malihabadi and Hafeez Jalandhari were at polar ends of an ideological divide that led to a poetic crescendo at the Bayaad-i-Josh mushaira in 1982On the other side of the political divide were pro-establishment writers and poets, chief among them Hafeez Jalandhari, the poet laureate, who had also penned Pakistan\u2019s national anthem","8728":"Their ideological divide was stark","8729":"Josh hated the British and sported the F\u00fchrer\u2019s moustache to remind them of their b\u00eate noire","8730":"In his poem East India Company Ke Farzandon Se Khitab [Address to the Heirs of the East India Company], Josh had lambasted British hypocrisy and recounted their crimes, from the battle of Plassey in 1757 to hanging the revolutionary Bhagat Singh in 1931","8731":"Invoking the powerful imagery of Karbala, he had addressed their apologists:Mujrimon ke waastay zeba nahin ye shor-o-shain\nKal Yazeed-o-Shimr thhey aur aaj bantay ho Hussain","8732":"[This hue and cry does not suit the defence of criminals\/ You who were Yazeed and Shimr yesterday pretend today to be Hussain","8733":"]Like anti-British revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose, who was even willing to ally himself with fascists to gain independence for India, Josh considered the British to be the ultimate enemy and published this poem in 1939 as the British were exploiting India in preparation for World War II","8734":"Meanwhile, Hafeez Jalandhari was using his pen to support the British war effort","8735":"During World War II, as the head of the Bureau of Public Information and Song Publicity Organisation at All India Radio, Jalandhari played an important role for British propaganda","8736":"According to several accounts, he wrote poems such as Boot to recruit Indian cannon fodder that would eventually die in North Africa and East Asia for their colonial masters:   Idhar pehno ho tooti jooti, udhar pehno ge boot\nBharti ho jao","8737":"[Here you wear a broken slipper, there you will get a fancy boot\/ Go join the army","8738":"] Jalandhari was able to get on the right side of the political players even after the Partition of the Subcontinent","8739":"While Tagore was the poet for India\u2019s and later Bangladesh\u2019s national anthems, Pakistan opted for a poet who is not part of the Urdu poetry pantheon but was still chosen out of 723 entrants","8740":"Rewards came quick and fast, he became the Director General of Morals in the Pakistan Armed Forces and an adviser to General Ayub Khan, an appointment which inspired Jalib to write his poem Musheer [Adviser]","8741":"As Jalib narrated, he happened to meet Jalandhari at Anarkali market in Lahore, who told him that he was exceedingly busy, as he had been appointed as an adviser","8742":"In response, Jalib sarcastically asked him, \u201cAdviser to God","8743":"\u201d","8744":"Protests were raging against Ayub Khan at the time, and Jalib caustically advised Jalandhari to lock up every black flag-raising protester and the Dastoor [Constitution]-reciting poet himself, who was daring to go against his president","8745":"In Musheer he proceeded to put into verse what he had said to Jalandhari: Das crore yeh gadhay\nKya banein ge hukmaraan[These hundred million fools\/ cannot ever be rulers]Given all this, it is hard to find two people more ideologically different than Josh and Jalandhari","8746":"This divide became personal when Jalandhari presented his work Shahnama-i-Islam to Josh and he curtly dismissed it by asking what Islam had to do with shahs [kings]","8747":"This rebuke and Josh\u2019s leftist writings had infuriated Jalandhari","8748":"As the director of the Writers\u2019 Guild, he could have played a role in suppressing Josh\u2019s poetry, and on Josh\u2019s demise, the Urdu daily Nawa-i-Waqt, published an article featuring a statement by Jalandhari that included this verse by Ghalib: Huay mar ke hum jo ruswa huay kyon na gharq-i-dariya\nNa kabhi janaza uthta na kahien mazar hota[Disgraceful death like this; why did I not die by drowning in a river\/ There would have been no funeral ever, and nowhere a tomb]The article was headlined with his statement, \u201cMarnay seh pehle usay mar jana chaahiye tha","8749":"Islam, Huzoor-i-Pak, aur Pakistan ke

Amrohvi recited at Josh\u2019s chehlum: Bazon ne woh bayaan diye hain ghalat ghaleez\nSari fazaayen cheekh uthi hain al Amaan\nal Hafeez","8755":"[Some have given statements so false and filthy\/ Even the winds are screaming: Allah safeguard us]The issue was smouldering and now at the Bayaad-i-Josh mushaira, Josh\u2019s friend Mahinder Singh Bedi responded on behalf of his departed friend to Jalandhari \u2019s unkind slur","8756":"An Indian was defending a Pakistani poet, proving that common decency, much like poetry, transcends petty politics","8757":"After extolling Josh\u2019s many virtues in his eulogy, he came to the crux of the matter","8758":"Bedi first laid the groundwork, saying that some people might not like what he was about to recite but, bitter as it might be, the truth must be told","8759":"The audience of thousands tensed in anticipation","8760":"The hum and buzz of the crowd was replaced by a stillness; the listeners did not want to miss a word of what was going to be said","8761":"Bedi led the charge in a voice heavy with emotion and suppressed outrage: Afsoos taanazan hain ghulamaan-i-khanazaad\nJin ke qaseeday ab bhi hain afrangiyon ko yaad\nZagh-o-zahan bhi boleeyan ab bolnay lagay\nShaheen jo urr gaya to yeh mounh kholnay lagay[Unfortunate that the sons of slaves are taunting\/ Whose paeans for the British are still remembered\/Magpies and kites have started opening their beaks\/ Now that the falcon has departed, they have become emboldened]The audience immediately understood the context and went hoarse in its praise, begging Bedi to repeat the verses","8762":"He had settled the score and reminded Jalandhari of his services to the imperial masters, previous and current","8763":"Later in the evening, Jalib proceeded to recite Musheer, a resounding double act of poetic dissent proving that, even dead and ignored by the state, Josh was the celebrated poet and, though alive and the establishment\u2019s man, there would be a reckoning for Jalandhari by his peers","8764":"Jalandhari did not survive Josh very long; he passed away on December 21, 1982","8765":"A man close to political circles in death as in life, his body rests in a tomb built by the government near the Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore","8766":"Josh\u2019s death was ignored by the state","8767":"Seeing this, Sadequain expressed a desire to build his grave, but the poet \u2014 whose pen targeted everyone from colonial masters to colonial servants and whose defiant words echo even today \u2014 was laid to rest in a simple white marble grave in Islamabad","8768":"The epitaph of the \u201cShair-i-Inqalab\u201d [Poet of Revolution] who never bowed or bent fittingly reads:Aainda zamanay ki amanat hoshiyar\nUth lehde moujud ki khoraak

buses","8810":"However, restrictions on the number of people allowed to travel by trains, planes and buses and the mandatory gap between the passengers will remain in place till September","8811":"These will be lifted by October if the situation allowed","8812":"These restrictions were enforced on March 16 to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country","8813":"\u201cRestaurants and cafes, outdoor and indoor, will be allowed to open from 10th August and standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be finalised in next two to three

and markets would follow the timings in place before the pandemic hit the country","8827":"He said the threat had not gone away, though the situation had improved due to implementation of SOPs by the administrative machinery","8828":"The minister said the NCOC worked as a \u201cnerve centre\u201d, but the situation improved because people cooperated and followed the SOPs","8829":"He termed the reduction in number of Covid-19 cases a success of the nation","8830":"\u201cHowever, people should not take it as complete victory as the situation can reverse in case of change in attitude of

the darkness","8845":"Quite literally","8846":"\u201cI was coming from Islamabad that night","8847":"Karachi lit up brightly as the plane started its descent","8848":"It looked beautiful,\u201d he said about the night in the last week of July when Karachi received torrential rain in record time and the city, according to everyone and her aunt, plunged into darkness for hours on end","8849":"Alvi insisted that only 40-50 feeders remained shut for more than six hours that night","8850":"\u201cOut of the total of 1,860 feeders, only 80-90 were off at the time (of descent),\u201d he said, implying that more than 95 per cent of the distribution network was up and running within a few hours of the heaviest rain the city has recorded in recent years","8851":"K-Electric CEO says loadshedding is an outcome of the federal government\u2019s flip-flops on key issuesIn a wide-ranging interview with Dawn last week in his office, the mild-mannered CEO of Karachi\u2019s sole power distribution company was downright dismissive of unflattering anecdotal evidence","8852":"An accountant by training, Alvi showed unassailable faith in the supremacy of numbers in his ledger","8853":"He made light of the public outcry over loadshedding","8854":"It is \u2018noise,\u2019 not signal","8855":"The disgruntled few outspeak the satisfied many","8856":"Electricity demand in Karachi peaked in the second week of July","8857":"It hit 3,600 megawatts but has since come down to around 3,300MW","8858":"Being a vertically integrated company, KE is solely responsible for generating, transmitting and selling electricity in Karachi and neighbouring towns","8859":"After accounting for the output of its own generation plants and electricity obtained from the national grid and independent power producers, KE can supply up to a maximum of 3,200MW to its consumers under the best conditions","8860":"So how did the power utility fail to anticipate demand despite being around since 2005 when it shed its old skin and was born anew under private ownership","8861":"The blame lies with the government, according to the KE CEO","8862":"\u201cWe knew even in 2014-15 that there would be a deficit in 2020","8863":"That\u2019s why we conceived a number of projects like a 900MW RLNG plant, a 700MW coal project and another 450MW RLNG project in collaboration with Engro","8864":"\u201dThe coal plant received approval, but the government then had afterthoughts","8865":"It insisted that the plant should run on local coal instead of imported one","8866":"KE redrew the entire plan and went back to the government for approval","8867":"But the government changed its mind for the second time","8868":"It asked KE to shelve the project for good","8869":"The government had already commissioned too much electricity elsewhere in the country","8870":"So it wanted KE to buy excess capacity in the national grid from the federal government\u2013owned National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC)","8871":"\u201cWe had planned for self-sufficiency","8872":"But the 900MW plant was delayed by two years for tariff reasons, the 700MW plant was shelved and the Engro plant was also put aside owing to excess capacity","8873":"If we were allowed to stick to the original plans, we would have sufficient electricity today even after relinquishing 650MW that we get from the federal government,\u201d he said","8874":"The government gave formal approval for evacuating excess energy from NTDC in June","8875":"KE expects to start doing it next year","8876":"Will 2021 be any different","8877":"The answer depends on Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to a large extent, Alvi says","8878":"It\u2019s supplying low-pressure gas, which makes it inefficient to run power plants","8879":"Half of the current supply-demand gap of 400MW can be bridged overnight only if SSGC ensured the right level of pressure, he said","8880":"But he cannot do anything about it because KE has no formal fuel purchase agreement with SSGC","8881":"The power sector regulator does not accept this excuse though","8882":"KE cannot be absolved of the negative impact that this underutilisation has on the consumer tariff, the regulator has said, because ensuring fuel availability is its own responsibility","8883":"\u201cIn the next seven to eight months, we will resolve the gas pressure issue even if we have to install new equipment or a new line,\u201d Alvi said","8884":"Projections are that peak demand in Karachi will touch 3,900MW next year","8885":"KE\u2019s current system can supply 3,000MW under normal circumstances","8886":"It expects to add another 300MW from the national grid","8887":"Separately, the company will shut down two of its old plants and add a new one, resulting in a net increase of 250-270MW","8888":"It means the total net addition to the KE system will be 550-570MW next year","8889":"Accounting for about 70MW from wind power plants and another 70MW from Kanupp, the KE system is expected to have around 3,700MW in 2021","8890":"This will still be 200MW short of peak demand","8891":"The power sector regulator reserved some stinging criticism for the company in one of its latest reports","8892":"\u201cHistorical record shows that KE underutilised its power plants whereas it continued to carry out loadshedding,\u201d said National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) in its recently released state of the industry report for 2019","8893":"In 2018-19, the latest period for which the company\u2019s financials are available, KE\u2019s net profit amounted to Rs17","8894":"2billion, up 40","8895":"3pc from a year ago","8896":"Yet the ratio of cash flow from operations to revenue remained negative, which means it\u2019s unable to turn its sales into usable hard cash","8897":"Meanwhile, KE\u2019s cash flow from financing activities rose by 761pc over the same period","8898":"This shows the company resorted to massive leverage \u2014 increasing debt as opposed to equity \u2014 to stay liquid","8899":"\u201cThe government has not paid us tariff differential claims since July 2016,\u201d Alvi retorted","8900":"But KE too has withheld payments to NTDC","8901":"Its current liabilities jumped 43","8902":"4pc in 2018-19 to Rs295","8903":"3bn","8904":"\u201cThey owe us Rs240bn and we owe them Rs170bn","8905":"KE should get Rs70bn if liabilities and receivables are netted off","8906":"We had to finance that gap by borrowing,\u201d he said","8907":"Turnaround story","8908":"Some commentators hail KE as a turnaround story","8909":"But many key performance indicators of KE don\u2019t bear comparison with those of state-owned distribution companies","8910":"For example, KE\u2019s recovery ratio was 92","8911":"6pc in 2018-19 as opposed to distribution companies of Multan (99","8912":"35pc), Faisalabad (99","8913":"3pc) and Lahore (97","8914":"7)","8915":"Similarly, KE\u2019s transmission and distribution losses (T&D) were also higher than those of many state-owned Discos","8916":"Average daily loadshedding by KE in 2018-19 was 1","8917":"77 hours, higher than that by Discos of Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala and Islamabad","8918":"In terms of the number of consumer service complaints, KE was once again at the top even though it\u2019s not the largest player","8919":"\u201cI don\u2019t know why these companies are posting losses if they have such fantastic recovery ratios and low T&D losses,\u201d Alvi said, implying some financial sleight of hand","8920":"The jury may still be out on whether consumers are better off with KE in private hands, but the verdict is loud and clear for its investors","8921":"They seem to have mistaken the map for the territory at a heavy cost","8922":"The company has reinvested all its profits amounting to Rs125bn since 2012","8923":"There has been neither dividends nor share price appreciation","8924":"Their consistent attempt to sell the company to Shanghai Electric Power has been unsuccessful since 2016","8925":"\u201cSponsors wanted to sell it for $1","8926":"88bn in 2016-17","8927":"That would translate into an 8pc return on investment, which wasn\u2019t very high,\u201d Alvi conceded","8928":"Hesitatingly speaking on the issue, he added the price will be lower than the earlier one now because of a sharp change in the exchange rate","8929":"The company claims to have invested $2","8930":"4bn since 2009 and intends to invest another $3bn in the next four years","8931":"Going by these numbers, the expected selling price looks underwhelming","8932":"Alvi reservedly agreed","8933":"\u201cOur new 900MW plant alone is worth $650m","8934":"In addition to that, our capex (capital expenditure) in 2020 is Rs30bn, which means another $160m","8935":"\u201dKE\u2019s holding company is KES Power, an offshore entity registered in the Cayman Islands","8936":"The doomed private equity fund Abraaj Capital held a majority stake in the offshore company until recently","8937":"But its name appears to have been airbrushed from the company\u2019s history after its CEO was arrested last year for misappropriating investors\u2019 funds","8938":"\u201cAbraaj Capital acted only as a management company","8939":"Investors actually belonged to the Infrastructure and Capital Growth Fund","8940":"Now Abraaj is gone","8941":"But the fund and the investors are here,\u201d Alvi said","8942":"Published in Dawn, The Business and

caused by the pandemic","9079":"After all, when people are suffering themselves, they are unlikely to have the ability to help others","9080":"More people will be thrown into dire economic circumstances without recourse","9081":"Instead of revelling in the glory of improved credit ratings, the Pakistani government should use the rest of the time during this ongoing crisis to develop a

Rawan\nDirector, Public Relations, AIOU\nIslamabadPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","9205":"Of all frightening ways that the Sars-Cov-2 virus affects the body, one of the more insidious is the effect of Covid-19 on the brain","9206":"It is now clear that many patients suffering from Covid-19 exhibit neurological symptoms, from loss of smell, to delirium, to an increased risk of stroke","9207":"There are also longer-lasting consequences for the brain, including myalgic encephalomyelitis \/chronic fatigue syndrome and Guillain-Barre syndrome","9208":"These effects may be caused by direct viral infection of brain tissue","9209":"But growing evidence suggests additional indirect actions triggered via the virus\u2019s infection of epithelial cells and the cardiovascular system, or through the immune system and inflammation, contribute to lasting neurological changes after Covid-19","9210":"I am a neuroscientist specialising in how memories are formed, the role of immune cells in the brain and how memory is persistently disrupted after illness and immune activation","9211":"As I survey the emerging scientific literature, my question is: Will there be a Covid-19-related wave of memory deficits, cognitive decline and dementia cases in the future","9212":"Many of the symptoms we attribute to an infection are really due to the protective responses of the immune system","9213":"A runny nose during a cold is not a direct effect of the virus, but a result of the immune system\u2019s response to the cold virus","9214":"This is also true when it comes to feeling sick","9215":"The general malaise, tiredness, fever and social withdrawal are caused by activation of specialised immune cells in the brain, called neuroimmune cells, and signals in the brain","9216":"These changes in brain and behaviour, although annoying for our everyday lives, are highly adaptive and immensely beneficial","9217":"By resting, you allow the energy-demanding immune response to do its thing","9218":"A fever makes the body less hospitable to viruses and increases the efficiency of the immune system","9219":"Social withdrawal may help decrease spread of the virus","9220":"In addition to changing behaviour and regulating physiological responses during illness, the specialised immune system in the brain also plays a number of other roles","9221":"It has recently become clear that the neuroimmune cells that sit at the connections between brain cells (synapses), which provide energy and minute quantities of inflammatory signals, are essential for normal memory formation","9222":"Unfortunately, this also provides a way in which illnesses like Covid-19 can cause both acute neurological symptoms and long-lasting issues in the brain","9223":"During illness and inflammation, the specialised immune cells in the brain become activated, spewing vast quantities of inflammatory signals, and modifying how they communicate with neurons","9224":"For one type of cell, microglia, this means changing shape, withdrawing the spindly arms and becoming blobby, mobile cells that envelop potential pathogens or cell debris in their path","9225":"But, in doing so, they also destroy and eat the neuronal connections that are so important for memory storage","9226":"Another type of neuroimmune cell called an astrocyte, typically wraps around the connection between neurons during illness-evoked activation and dumps inflammatory signals on these junctions, effectively preventing the changes in connections between neurons that store memories","9227":"Because Covid-19 involves a massive release of inflammatory signals, the impact of this disease on memory is particularly interesting to me","9228":"That is because there are both short-term effects on cognition (delirium), and the potential for long-lasting changes in memory, attention and cognition","9229":"There is also an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, during ageing","9230":"If activation of neuroimmune cells is limited to the duration of the illness, then how can inflammation cause long-lasting memory deficits or increase the risk of cognitive decline","9231":"Both the brain and the immune system have specifically evolved to change as a consequence of experience, in order to neutralise danger and maximise survival","9232":"In the brain, changes in connections between neurons allows us to store memories and rapidly change behaviour to escape threat, or seek food or social opportunities","9233":"The immune system has evolved to fine-tune the inflammatory response and antibody production against previously encountered pathogens","9234":"Yet long-lasting changes in the brain after illness are also closely linked to increased risk for age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s disease","9235":"The disruptive and destructive actions of neuroimmune cells and inflammatory signalling can permanently impair memory","9236":"This can occur through permanent damage to the neuronal connections or neurons themselves and also via more subtle changes in how neurons function","9237":"The potential connection between Covid-19 and persistent effects on memory are based on observations of other illnesses","9238":"For example, many patients who recover from heart attack or bypass surgery report lasting cognitive deficits that become exaggerated during ageing","9239":"Another major illness with a similar cognitive complications is sepsis \u2013 multi-organ dysfunction triggered by inflammation","9240":"In animal models of these diseases, we also see impairments of memory, and changes in neuroimmune and neuronal function that persist weeks and months after illness","9241":"Even mild inflammation, including chronic stress, are now recognised as risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline during ageing","9242":"In my own laboratory, I and my colleagues have also observed that even without bacterial or viral infection, triggering inflammatory signalling over a short-term period results in long-lasting changes in neuronal function in memory-related brain regions and memory impairments","9243":"It will be many years before we know whether the Covid-19 infection causes an increased risk for cognitive decline or Alzheimer\u2019s disease","9244":"But this risk may be decreased or mitigated through prevention and treatment of Covid-19","9245":"Prevention and treatment both rely on the ability to decrease the severity and duration of illness and inflammation","9246":"Intriguingly, very new research suggests that common vaccines, including the flu shot and pneumonia vaccines, may reduce risk for Alzheimer\u2019s","9247":"Additionally, several emerging treatments for Covid-19 are drugs that suppress excessive immune activation and inflammatory state","9248":"Potentially, these treatments will also reduce the impact of inflammation on the brain, and decrease the impact on long-term brain health","9249":"Covid-19 will continue to impact health and well-being long after the pandemic is over","9250":"As such, it will be critical to continue to assess the effects of Covid-19 illness in vulnerability to later cognitive decline and dementia","9251":"In doing so, researchers will likely gain critical new insight into the role of inflammation across the life-span in age-related cognitive decline","9252":"This will aid in the development of more effective strategies for prevention and treatment of these debilitating illnesses","9253":"This article first appeared in The Conversation and has been reproduced with permission","9254":"LAHORE: Pakistan fast bowling coach Waqar Younis has

yet and we will bounce back","9261":"These guys have won matches for Pakistan back at home","9262":"\u201dWaqar, however, was clueless when asked who will play the second Test, saying: \u201cIt is Misbah-ul-Haq\u2019s job to finalise the playing XI being the head coach and chief selector whereas my role is limited to consultation only","9263":"\u201dWaqar said he had no idea about the pitch as the team and its management had just arrived at the stadium and he didn\u2019t have a look at it","9264":"When asked about Shadab Khan\u2019s place in the team,  Waqar defended the leg-spinner\u2019s performance with the willow in the last Test thereby keeping the window open for any possible change in the playing squad for the second Test","9265":"\u201cI think Shadab\u2019s performance with the bat was quite satisfactory as he scored in both innings","9266":"Although,  he was not fully used as a bowler but overall his performance was good","9267":"The final decision, however, rests with Misbah,\u201d he said","9268":"About losing the first Test, Waqar said it was disappointing","9269":"\u201cI think we won more sessions of that Test and we really played well but we lost one session at a wrong time and it cost us the game,\u201d he said","9270":"When asked about the batsmen\u2019s poor performance, he said: \u201cHad Pakistan won the Test, I believe no such questions would have been posed to me, so, all of this is happening because we lost the first Test","9271":"\u201dAbout Azhar Ali\u2019s poor run with the bat, Waqar said: \u201cAzhar is the right man to answer this question","9272":"It\u2019s not easy to do captaincy and then bat at the top border","9273":"He is going through a lean patch and it is not the first time he is facing such a situation as he has overcome it in the past","9274":"He is a seasoned player and has scored in England","9275":"He will deliver in upcoming matches","9276":"\u201dTo a question about Nasim Shah, Waqar said he was a very talented bowler, bowling at a tender age of 17 or 18","9277":"\u201dNasim is still very young and what a talent he is","9278":"He really bowled well in the previous game and that is exactly what we were expecting from him","9279":"\u201cWe dominated  the first Test for the first three and half days but in the end, England burnt their bridges and took away the game from us,\u201d he said","9280":"\u201cTo become a great bowler in future, Nasim, however, has to keep himself fit and strong to bowl long spells to beat the batsmen world over","9281":"\u201cAs a fast bowler, you should look into the eyes of batsmen, trust your abilities and that is exactly what he did","9282":"He is still learning and with experience he will go further,\u201d Waqar said","9283":"To a question about the England team\u2019s missing all-rounder Ben Stokes, Waqar said: \u201cHe is the kind of cricketer who can take away the game single-handedly","9284":"In the first Test, we made a plan against him and executed it well, but no doubt he is a match-winner","9285":"\u201cYes, he is not around (in the next Test) and it is unfortunate for cricket and England will feel it in the middle-order, but we will try to cash it,\u201d he said","9286":"Waqar also praised leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who took eight wickets in the first Test","9287":"\u201cHe is a match-winner and a very attacking bowler who likes to be involved in the game all the time \u2014 both with the ball and bat","9288":"His records speak for the talent he has but unfortunately he could not finish the last game in Pakistan\u2019s favour,\u201d he said","9289":"Defending  the heavy coaching staff, Waqar said: \u201cYes it is a heavyweight dressing room and there is no doubt about it","9290":"But unfortunately, the coaching staff can only sit outside the ground and not inside it","9291":"So the coaches can only give the players a plan, coaching tips whereas the players are responsible for executing it on the ground","9292":"\u201dTill filing of the report, the team management has not announced the list of 16 probables for the second Test","9293":"There are reports that the grass on the pitch has been removed which has forced the team management to reconsider the list of probables","9294":"Published in Dawn, August 13th, 2020","9295":"SHANGHAI: Chinese entrants to the race to put

economic burden on the government by providing meals, medical assistance and other key services to low-income groups","9476":"In a bid to help further their cause during these challenging times,

immediate emergency disaster relief for the many vulnerable, neglected parts of Pakistan","9478":"As Covid-19 reduced access to food and other essential goods for communities around the world, PepsiCo

marginalised","9484":"Apart from millions of meals, there were also millions of stories","9485":"Let's hear them","9486":"Empowering minority groups that are often misrepresented and marginalised in a country marred by hunger and poverty is a tough job","9487":"Add to that a global health emergency like the coronavirus outbreak and the magnitude of the challenge increases tenfold","9488":"Supported by PepsiCo, Orange Tree Foundation took on the responsibility of reaching out to thousands of vulnerable households and transgender communities in Sindh; in Thatta and Badin, Baba and Bhit Islands,

community reps belonging to the transgender and fisherman community","9490":"Life in Karachi's busy Port area waits for nothing, and acknowledges no one","9491":"People like Abdul Razzak know that all too well","9492":"For the inhabitants of Shams Pir village in Bhit Island, Razzak is no less than a saint; this also why they often call him Haji Razzak","9493":"Talking about the many struggles of the fishermen and their families at Baba and Bhit Island, Razzak told us, \"80% of these people are so poor that they cannot afford any meals","9494":"Their debts are huge and there is no one coming for help","9495":"No matter what problems they go through, the people here know they can knock at Razzak bhai's door at any time of the day","9496":"I do all that I can to help these people earn a

times, it was Hanif who would get up as early as 6am and continue distribution of meals at Baba and Bhit Islands till late in the night, without a break or even a hint of a frown","9500":"Such is the

transgender community, Zehrish has high hopes from a city that honours nothing but privilege","9502":"She believes people can help their community dispel stereotypes, and that alone will empower them

Safoora goth, Pehlwan goth, Sachal goth, Bin Qasim Pipri, Baldia town, and Saadullah goth near Hub chauki","9504":"Speaking to us about the condition of her community, Zehrish says, \"People have

because I feel uneasy when they say I am good for nothing","9512":"People like me do not get the same amount of respect or space as other family members","9513":"I was surprised to see so many disabled persons show up at the distribution point despite the many challenges of commute, lack of support from family, and stereotypes we experience in everyday life","9514":"Zulfiqar Ali played an active role as a community rep and volunteer; he represented disabled people of his community and also gave the team valuable insights on the social dynamics of Sujawal","9515":"Reaching faraway, neglected areas of Balochistan, People\u2019s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) is running meal distribution drives in two phases; phase one focused on Killa Abdulla, Panjgoor, Lasbella, Quetta,

way; the biggest being identification of beneficiaries via community support groups and district administration","9517":"Widows and mothers of four and six respectively, Sherbano and Bibi Ruksana's struggle began as a startled, pandemic-hit Pakistan was locked down earlier this year","9518":"After the death of her husband, who was a daily wager, Bibi Ruksana worked in the fields of BHU Segai to earn her daily income; the area is known as a disputed territory faced with multiple tribal issues, which make it hard to transport goods and commute in the township","9519":"Upon receiving the support she needed, Bibi cheered and said she will ensure that the supplies last long enough for her household to survive the lockdown, and hopefully the pandemic","9520":"At the brink of a nationwide lockdown earlier this year, inhabitants of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,  Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir had a challenging question at hand: will there be food on the tables if their towns are shut indefinitely","9521":"Stretched across Pakistan's most breathtaking landscapes, the provinces offer unparalleled peace, beauty and warmth to their inhabitants, but limited opportunities of safe and sustainable income; most underprivileged people here are pushed to survive on daily wages, with scarce resources to counter difficult living conditions","9522":"To reach out to these communities, organisations like Al-Khidmat, Mehnaz Fatima Foundation and National Rural Support Program (NRSP) stepped forward","9523":"Since most of these households are located in hilly areas, transportation of goods remained one of the key struggles in the process","9524":"With the help of around 500 volunteers, these three organisations transported meals to many cities, including Swabi, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Buner, Malakand, upper and lower Dir, Dera Ismail Khan, Astore and Gilgit, and 10 districts of AJK, including Bagh, Bhimber, Hattian, Haveli, Kotli, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Poonch and Sudhnoti","9525":"All three are daily wagers expected to feed households of up to 12 members, all by themselves","9526":"For Nadeem, Muhammad and Siffat, the pandemic came as an additional burden on the already distressed financial conditions of their household","9527":"They ran out of jobs, faced restricted outdoor movement, and worried about the future of their families and the many

and neglected communities she sees around her","9534":"Volunteering for NRSP since 2011, Saima's dedication and hard work, NRSP was able to identify 12 critically poor families who were unable to fight poverty due to the pandemic","9535":"For the rest of the world, Covid-19 brought with itself heaps of a deadly virus that harmed their healthcare systems","9536":"But for the developing world, the biggest challenge that surfaced was hunger and food insecurity","9537":"Leveraging technology, Rizq Foundation joined hands with the Millions of Meals initiative, and registered millions of empty plates on an app and began distributing meals","9538":"While most human welfare work on the outside looks like simple math equations, the process on the inside is much different","9539":"On the very first day of work, Rizq realised there were plenty of obstacles awaiting response; price fluctuations in the market because people across the country were busy panic-buying and hoarding essentials, and the possibility of duplication of assistance in the selected areas as tons of other non-governmental organisations sprouted to lend a hand","9540":"To work this out and ensure transparency, the organisation collaborated with all existing non-governmental organisations in the said areas, and with the help of a specialised app, recorded and shared data, registered all beneficiaries and assigned them QR codes","9541":"This ensured accuracy of delivery, and prevented double-counting and misallocation","9542":"Part of Rizq Foundation's team of 100 volunteers, Fazal Kabli and Usama Zahid worked relentlessly towards the organisation's mission","9543":"With the pandemic happening and all major parts of the country locked down, Fazal and Usama brought infectious energy and a whole lot of passion to work every day","9544":"Leaving behind all personal engagements, including university classes and tough schedules, they worked on the distribution drive every day, ensuring there were no hiccups or delays","9545":"Apart from the NGOs and the volunteers, the \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is also supported whole-heartedly internally by PepsiCo associates","9546":"Many PepsiCo employees donated generously to add more meals for the programme","9547":"To facilitate and grow this drive even more, the PepsiCo Foundation announced a generous \u2018Double Match Program\u2019, which means that for every Rupee donated by a PepsiCo associate, another two Rupees will be donated by the PepsiCo Foundation","9548":"The combined power of the associates and the PepsiCo Foundation has enabled distribution of an additional 330,000 meals across Pakistan","9549":"Pakistan is the land of hopes, aspirations and many triumphs, with which come challenges aplenty","9550":"The \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is rooted in PepsiCo's global vision of 'Winning with Purpose', which is the organisation's promise to do all to save the planet and its many communities","9551":"PepsiCo's partnership aims to continue its support for charitable organisations that provide millions of meals to millions of communities, helping them ward off hunger caused by complete and partial economic inactivity in various parts of the country due to the pandemic","9552":"To sustain these efforts, the company has announced an investment of Rs775 million ($5million

7,000 were being performed officially while others in the private sector","9560":"Some health and medical experts believe that the tests were reduced when the positive cases ratio dropped to 10 per cent in Punjab","9561":"They were of the view that the Punjab government has cut down the number of tests to avoid wastage of funds because of the continuous decrease in positive ratio","9562":"On average the Punjab government was to bear cost of Rs3,000 per test and expenses on 90 per cent of the total tests being performed daily were going waste, they claimed","9563":"However, some critics

including pilgrims who arrived from Iran, Tableeghi Jamaat members, media workers, security forces, passengers arriving from abroad, government employees etc","9576":"As the government has stopped performing tests of above-mentioned people, the test ratio decreased automatically, he said","9577":"Meanwhile, the positive rate of the cases also witnessed a sharp decrease in Punjab, the official said","9578":"While giving a reference\/example in this respect, he said, the health teams on Friday performed 5,301 tests across the province","9579":"Of them only 218 people tested positive for the

exist","9683":"Moreover, every now and then, Pakistani fashion has celebrated some proud sartorial moments by making waves globally","9684":"This Independence Day, here are some of the times when Pakistani fashion really made the world sit up and take notice: Dressing Princess Diana when she visited Pakistan back in 1996 has always remained one of designer Rizwan Beyg\u2019s fondest memories \u2013 but it is also one of Pakistani fashion\u2019s proudest moments","9685":"You may have read earlier about how the royal princess came to wear a hand-embroidered ivory achkan created by Rizwan but it\u2019s a story worth repeating here","9686":"Rizwan was asked by Jemima Khan to create a design for a special guest who was flying in from abroad for a Shaukat Khanum fundraiser","9687":"She didn\u2019t reveal the guest\u2019s identity but Rizwan had his suspicions","9688":"He did some research on the princess\u2019 sartorial preferences and discovered that she had a penchant for pearl embroideries and shades of ivory","9689":"The achkan was designed accordingly","9690":"When Diana visited Pakistan, Rizwan met her and when he asked her if she would take a photograph with him, she especially wore the clothes that he had created for her","9691":"Rizwan\u2019s crowning moment, however, was when the Princess wore the outfit twice \u2013 for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital fundraisers in both Lahore and London","9692":"In fact, on the day she signed the papers of her divorce with Prince Charles, Diana later attended the London fundraiser wearing Rizwan Beyg","9693":"It was a day when London\u2019s paparazzi was buzzing and a multitude of her pictures floated out on to media","9694":"And while the princess may have been going through her personal turmoil at that

through Pakistan last year","9696":"The couples\u2019 team of stylists went on an online shopping spree and visited O\u2019nitaa, a London-based multi-designer store stocking Pakistani brands,

three local designers showed complete collections at one of the world\u2019s leading fashion runways, the Milan Fashion Week","9704":"Rizwan Beyg, Maheen Khan and Deepak Perwani were all part of the New Upcoming Designers (N-U-De) category and played to their strengths: Rizwan with a collection in ivory with pearl embellishments, Maheen with a \u2018Khyber Mail\u2019 line inspired by the Khyber and Deepak, with a vivacious mix of colours","9705":"The shows won rave reviews from the international press and one wishes that the designers\u2019 Milan experience had not been a one-off","9706":"Unfortunately, the three designers \u2013 or any others \u2013 have not showcased at MFW again \u2013 although their successes from those long ago shows did help build their businesses further","9707":"Pakistan made its mark in Milan yet again last year when Italian designer Stella Jean collaborated with the indigenous craftswoman of the Kalash valley and create an entire collection embellished with their handwork","9708":"Stella went the extra mile and also made the effort to incorporate two local models in her show at MFW: Mushk Kaleem and Alicia Khan","9709":"It was a moment of victory for local craft, being featured on one of the world\u2019s most prestigious catwalks with two of Pakistan\u2019s own as part of the show","9710":"Later, Mushk and Alicia, along with jewellery designer Sherezad Rahimtoola and footballer Karishma Ali, who had helped with the collaboration, posed with the Pakistani flag","9711":"Seeing a familiar logo in a foreign land can trigger a sense of patriotic pride","9712":"A \u2018Khaadi\u2019 logo, for instance, in London\u2019s Westfield Mall, or a \u2018Faraz Manan\u2019 sign on Dubai\u2019s swanky Al Wasal

of his own is Faraz Manan who is the only Pakistani designer to have a standalone store in one of Dubai\u2019s most \u2018it\u2019 areas","9717":"The store, with its glossy interiors, is testament to the designer\u2019s considerable Middle Eastern clientele","9718":"It also sets Faraz apart from his peers \u2013 no other Pakistani designer has an international flagship retail presence and there are even only a handful of Indian designers with stores of their own in Dubai","9719":"Finely worked Pakistani couture, evidently, can sell very well in the international marketplace","9720":"Now if

world","9991":"Credit reporting data helps establish the repayment history of borrowers to make it easier for them to access loans by allowing creditors to assess the repayment capacities of their customers and support their credit-risk monitoring","9992":"The regulators use this data to monitor credit markets and lending\/borrowing trends","9993":"The World Bank\u2019s annual flagship publication, Doing Business, which presents quantitative measures of the regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it in 189 countries, also covers at least two aspects of the regulations that affect the availability of credit","9994":"First, it looks into the depth of credit information \u2014 the coverage, scope and accessibility of information available to lenders through credit bureaus","9995":"Two, it measures the strength of the legal rights to evaluate the degree to which secured transactions or collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of both borrowers and lenders to facilitate lending","9996":"In recent years, there has been a growth in the trend towards the expansion of the scope and quality of credit reporting services around the world","9997":"Currently, more than 50 countries have established credit reporting systems, credit bureaus or registries to not only help creditors manage their risk but also as an effective tool to strengthen financial inclusion, particularly women, low-income groups, and micro and small businesses","9998":"\u2018It is not the job of the SBP to run a credit information bureau; its job is to regulate the private bureaus and ensure that all creditors willingly contribute their data to existing bureaus\u2019In Pakistan, where only a fraction of population is connected with the nation\u2019s financial system, the dream of higher levels of financial inclusion allowing access to low-income individuals remains unrealised in spite of the efforts made in the last couple of decades","9999":"To promote financial inclusion, the parliament passed the Credit Information Bureau Act 2015 to pave the way for establishing private credit bureaus as part of the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS)","10000":"Under the Act, the central bank has so far issued licenses to two private credit bureaus, which have replaced several unlicensed registries operating in the country before","10001":"The role of the unlicensed credit bureaus or registries was nevertheless limited to data collection from financial institutions, which voluntarily shared data with them","10002":"However, industry sources tell this correspondent, the licensed private bureaus are struggling to collect information from the creditors for developing reliable registries of credit data of both individuals and corporate entities because of gaps in the Act","10003":"Besides, the central bank\u2019s Electronic Credit Information Bureau also continues to operate, creating negative competition for the private credit bureaus","10004":"\u201cIt is not the job of the SBP to run a credit information bureau; its job is to regulate the private bureaus, ensure that all creditors willingly contribute their data to these bureaus, and develop a competitive environment for them in the country,\u201d a senior microfinance banker from Karachi commenting on the condition of anonymity","10005":"He urged the SBP to develop a standard format for all creditors to follow for ensuring the availability of uniform credit history information of their clients to the bureaus","10006":"Moreover, the Act makes it mandatory for the financial and credit institutions to become a member and share data with at least one of the licensed private credit bureaus","10007":"Citing this clause, the creditors often refuse to share their data with both the bureaus","10008":"Thus, the Act itself discourages healthy and fair competition between existing bureaus and is a disincentive for them to improve their services and reduce their user fees","10009":"The Act, according to the banker, needs to be amended to make it compulsory for all creditors to share credit information of their clients to all the licensed bureaus, which will result in improvement in services provided by them and ensure availability of uniform, complete credit histories of individual and corporate borrowers to those who need it","10010":"Another issue being faced by the bureaus is resistance from creditors on sharing information on their clients to all bureaus operating in the market","10011":"According to Mumtaz Hussain Syed, the CEO of Aequitas Information Services, the first bureau operating under the brand name of Tasdeeq, the rules and regulations of the business applicable to non-banking financial institutions, telecommunication companies and utilities also need to be updated to bring them in line with the Credit Information Bureau Act","10012":"Since the Act also mandates private credit bureaus to gather data from such unconventional sources as utilities, telecommunication firms and retailers, a few bottlenecks need to be removed","10013":"\u201cThe coverage of the scope of the Act to these sources of credit history information of their clients is a significant step towards enhancing financial inclusion,\u201d he argues","10014":"\u201cBut greater cooperation and collaboration is required among different players to implement this","10015":"\u201dMumtaz Hussain Syed points out that the key issue in gathering data from the utility companies is related to the ownership of the utility connections as the tenants and new owners don\u2019t usually transfer the ownership of the existing connections in their names because it is a cumbersome process","10016":"\u201cConsequently, the payment behaviour of the consumers is not captured even if the companies share their data with the credit bureaus","10017":"There is an urgent need for reforms to relax these procedures of utilities for improving the quality of data provided by the utility companies,\u201d he stresses","10018":"He is of the view that many issues could be solved by improving cooperation between different regulators","10019":"\u201cWe have conflicting regulations for some sectors and firms, which bar them from sharing data of their customers with any the bureaus","10020":"For example, telecom companies can be a great source of data sharing as they have nearly 130 million subscribers","10021":"But the regulations don\u2019t permit them from sharing their customer information","10022":"\u201dThe collection of data from these sources will allow the banks, utility firms, retailers and other creditors offer much better information on their clients\u2019 (over) indebtedness, discipline credit market and manage their risk","10023":"In addition, their customers with a good credit history will be able to get better deals like lower interest rates from the creditors","10024":"More important, it will help the government and the SBP achieve the elusive financial inclusion targets of the NFIS","10025":"Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, July 13th, 2020","10026":"Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry recently revealed that three million jobs have been lost because of

form of documenting the exotic flora and fauna found in the Subcontinent, the East India Company appointed local miniature painters to create these works, which differed from the traditional miniature

the traditional Peshwaas, which makes one question, which of the two styles one sees several men wear today","10042":"Even horses were affected by this rule: as one stands strong and natural, another

in need for Britian\u2019s enlightened rule","10046":"In Zeeshan\u2019s series, the women create a contrast between the physical alterations forced on to some under British rule, while there is an exoticisation of the nakedness of others","10047":"The artworks become the concluding chapter to Forgotten Masters, one that is told through the postcolonial artist who is witness of the remnants of

thorns, hot sands, a place where lovers thrive","10075":"The poem is at once an evocation and an absence; the narrator addresses an absent lover, asks him to turn his camel away from Rohi desert and come back to her","10076":"Where is she","10077":"In a town some miles away from the desert\u2019s edge","10078":"Has she ever seen the landscape of Rohi which she evokes with such wonder and pathos","10079":"Unlike the narrator of Kalidasa\u2019s poem \u2018Meghdoot\u2019, who asks the eponymous cloud to take messages back from his place of exile to Malwa where his wife awaits him, the

the narrator encounters changing times of day; senses the presence of ancient, vanished cities abandoned because of changing weather; sees clear luminous ponds; the flight of birds such as black

of master librarians \u2014 D N Marshall, B Anderson and S R Tikekar \u2014 the library began acquiring the books and manuscripts of many Bombay residents and built up a collection which has few

few years ago, that I discovered a copy of the 1908 English novel My Friend, The Barrister written by K E Ghamat","10161":"Later, I encountered another novel, Pootli, A Story of Life in Bombay by the husband-and-wife team of Ardeshir F J Chinoy and (Mrs) Dinbai A F Chinoy","10162":"The plague epidemic which raged in Bombay for over a decade from 1896 is a significant character in this 1915 novel which starts thus:\"Ten miles distant from the picturesque city of Bombay, and separated\n  from it by the Mahim Creek, stands the peaceful and healthy suburb of\n  Bandora [Bandra]","10163":"Its two hills, one running to the north and the\n  other to the south, are dotted over with pretty villas, surrounded by\n  well-laid-out gardens and tenanted mostly be Europeans and Parsis","10164":"During the first outbreak of the plague in Bombay in 1896, Bandora,\n  which was then little known, soon became a place of refuge for the\n  panic-stricken inhabitants of Bombay, which presented a spectacle more\n  or less similar to that of London in the dark days of the Black\n  Plague","10165":"The panic was so severe that whole streets were deserted,\n  schools had to be closed, and college-lectures delivered before more\n  or less empty benches","10166":"\" Set in the two decades before its publication, the novel\u2019s wide cast of characters are drawn into a web of relationships only to be separated by disease and death","10167":"My Friend, The Barrister also begins with an account of a dreaded but more familiar disease \u2014 the small pox \u2014 while describing the childhood of the protagonist, again \"in the picturesque but now over-crowded suburb of Bandra","10168":"\"\"When seven years old a serious malady befell poor Rustim or Russy as\n  his parents endearingly called him","10169":"The attack was severe, and his\n  life was in peril","10170":"The aid of guardian angels was invoked and vows\n  were made","10171":"The mother became frantic and the father, disconsolate","10172":"Their darling son was in the grip of death","10173":"The best of physicians\n  were called in, and money was not spared","10174":"By degrees the child recovered","10175":"The recovery was miraculous, since the\n  liver had become obstinate, and had threatened to strike work in\n  consultation with its friend the kidney","10176":"It was an achievement for\n  modern science, and the doctors congratulated themselves","10177":"The mother,\n  however, ascribed the recovery to the kindly offices of the guardian\n  angels","10178":"Perhaps she was right","10179":"Perhaps the doctors were right","10180":"\"These two books were the first novels to be written in English by Parsis","10181":"A select number of Parsis had been conducting their business correspondence in English from the early 1800s, and perhaps even in the eighteenth century","10182":"By the 1830s, the language was being used for non-business purposes as Indians became editors of English newspapers","10183":"In the next decade, English travelogues written by Parsis for a chiefly European audience were published in London","10184":"The first was the Diary of an Overland Journey from Bombay to England, and of a Year\u2019s Residence in Great Britain (1840) by Ardaseer Cursetjee Wadia","10185":"Parsis soon began to explore other genres of literature, poetry being the foremost","10186":"By 1900, there was a substantial number of Indian readers for writing in English, though Gujarati was the language of choice for an overwhelming majority of Parsis","10187":"Poets like Behramji M Malabari (1853-1912), whose The Indian Muse in English Garb (1877) had attracted critical attention, began to achieve a measure of fame","10188":"Malabari himself went on to write prolifically in English, besides editing The Indian Spectator, an Indian nationalist journal","10189":"Cornelia Sorabji (1866\u20131954), the first Indian lady advocate, began writing short stories in the 1890s, which were collected under the title Love and Life beyond the Purdah (1901)","10190":"Though, as a woman, she was debarred from pleading in courts, she made important contributions to the rights of Indian women in a long legal career that spanned three decades","10191":"She also wrote prolifically in English and published two autobiographies and a memoir of her parents","10192":"The novel as a genre appears rather late in most Indian languages","10193":"It was only in the last third of the nineteenth century that writers began experimenting with this form","10194":"The famous Bengali novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee\u2019s first attempt in fiction, Rajmohan\u2019s Wife (1864), was in English before he switched to Bengali","10195":"There were others in Calcutta and Madras who tried to write English novels before 1900","10196":"It was, however, only in the twentieth century that the Indian novel in English began to take shape and it was influenced by contemporary events","10197":"In Bombay, the plague had impacted every aspect of life so deeply that it could not be ignored","10198":"Neither could the charged political and social situation in the country","10199":"Kaikhosroo Edaljee Ghamat, a witness to the increased political activity and the rise of the Congress in the previous two decades, was deeply concerned with the political developments of the period","10200":"He may have closely followed the careers of other Parsis like Dinshaw E Vachha and Pherozeshah Mehta","10201":"One of the issues which agitated Indians was the attitude of Europeans, then referred to as Anglo-Indians, towards the natives of India","10202":"During the best of times, it could be dismissive but often enough, it was downright obnoxious","10203":"A combination of racist prejudice and unfair laws had made the situation intolerable in a climate where Indians were beginning to fight for their rights","10204":"Their experience in India was in sharp contrast to their experience when they travelled to London and elsewhere in Europe","10205":"As early as the 1870s, the Bombay nationalist Nowrozjee Furdoonjee had caused \"consternation in Simla and Calcutta by publicly speaking out against racist British attitudes towards Indians,\" notes the historian Dinyar Patel","10206":"Ghamat hoped that closer personal interactions between the two communities would mitigate any misunderstanding that might have prevailed between them","10207":"In 1906, he wrote and published a Gujarati book titled Hindustanni haalni halat ane Anglo-Indian ne ek appeal (the present condition of Hindustan and an appeal to Anglo-Indians) to present his ideas","10208":"While members from the two communities could invite each other to their social gatherings and private parties, Ghamat went one step further in his book by advocating romance and marriage between them","10209":"This was an altogether revolutionary idea for the early twentieth century","10210":"At a time when there was hardly any public interaction between the sexes, the suggestion of romantic alliances between the races would have certainly raised many eyebrows","10211":"Perhaps the first prominent Parsi to carry on a liaison with an Englishwoman was Ardaseer Cursetjee Wadia (1808-1877)","10212":"Belonging to the Wadia clan of shipwrights, he was an engineer par excellence","10213":"Among the many firsts to his credit were the first privately built steamship in India (1833) and the first gaslights of Bombay (1834)","10214":"As noted earlier, Wadia stayed in London for a year in 1840 and was the first Parsi to publish a travelogue in English","10215":"In the following year, he became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society","10216":"Wadia was a frequent visitor to London in the 1850s","10217":"It was during one of these visits that he likely met Marian Barber with whom he became romantically involved","10218":"She seems to have followed him to Bombay where she gave birth to two of their three children","10219":"After a brilliant career as an inventor and engineer in the Bombay Dockyard, Wadia retired on a generous pension and permanently settled in the UK with his British family in 1859","10220":"As his first wife Avabai was still alive, he never formalised his relationship with Marian Barber","10221":"Even though his professional achievements were of the highest order, his name was frequently expunged from Parsi biographical records and no mention was made of his second family","10222":"The affair caused great scandal in Bombay","10223":"It therefore did not take long for rumours to circulate among the Parsis of Bombay that Dadabhai Naoroji had married a European lady when he first went to London in 1855 to establish a trading business","10224":"Naoroji was at great pains to publicly deny this accusation in the Gujarati newspaper Rast Goftar when he returned to Bombay in 1858","10225":"Four decades later, for a Parsi to suggest inter-racial alliances in the early 1900s was to launch a frontal attack on the social mores of the day","10226":"It was also in direct opposition to their interpretation of Zoroastrianism, which forbade the initiation of the progeny of such marriages into the religion","10227":"In his appeal to Anglo-Indians, but written in Gujarati, Ghamat asked that they voluntarily change their attitudes to Indians and establish personal and friendly relations with them","10228":"The appeal, like many others before it, seems to have gone unheeded","10229":"This prompted Ghamat to alter his strategy: he would write in English and present his ideas in the garb of fiction","10230":"In January 1908, Ghamat self-published My Friend, The Barrister, where he \"ventured to step out of the prosaic domain of law to revel for a while in the romantic regions of fiction\"","10231":"Priced at a rupee and a half, the bookseller D B Taraporevala advertised it on the front pages of the Times of India (2 April 1908)","10232":"THEY ALL HAVE READ \nTHE HIGHLY SENSATIONAL \nPARSEE NOVEL, \nMY FRIEND, THE BARRISTER \nBY A PARSEE BARRISTER-AT-LAW","10233":"INTERMARRIAGES BETWEEN THE PARSEES \nAND THE ENGLISH","10234":"Ghamat could not resist including a preface to the novel:\"I have attempted to point out some of the ugly pitfalls of the\n  Administration, and to depict the prejudice and distrust which\n  unfortunately exist in the minds of not a few Anglo-Indians against\n  the people of India, and which are assiduously kept alive by inflated,\n  insidious and one-sided criticism constantly appearing in a\n  considerable number of Anglo-Indian journals, supplemented by unwise\n  utterances of a few officials moulded in the pernicious cast of racial\n  superiority, infallible judgment and self-interestedness","10235":"There are perhaps no other people on God\u2019s earth who are more\n  mercilessly misjudged and thoughtlessly maligned at the present day\n  than the Indians, and unless the mist of prejudice and distrust\n  against them, is raised, there can be, I am afraid, no guarantee that\n  the political horizon of India will always remain free from\n  threatening clouds of discord, dissension and turmoil","10236":"\"Ghamat\u2019s novel seems to be largely autobiographical","10237":"In 1888, a 21-year-old Ghamat went to London after his graduation from the University of Bombay to study law","10238":"At London, he kept terms at the Middle Temple and qualified as a barrister in 1891","10239":"He was an exact contemporary of M K Gandhi and it is possible that, as fellow Gujaratis, they may well have come into contact in London, a connection they could have even renewed in Bombay in the 1890s when both of them were just beginning their professional life","10240":"Ghamat came back to India to practise law, first at the Thane district courts, before joining the Bombay Bar in 1904","10241":"Following in the footsteps of Ghamat himself, the protagonist Rustim, after a sunny suburban childhood marred only by smallpox, prepares to leave Bombay to study law in London","10242":"\"Friday, the 10th day of August 18 \u2014 was fixed for Rustim\u2019s departure for England by the steamship Good Hope","10243":"\" In the context of the novel, the year could only be 1888, the same year in which Ghamat himself departed","10244":"On the ship, Rustim inevitably meets Englishmen who treat him roughly, but there are a few kindly souls on board","10245":"At London, he enjoys a congenial domestic life with his landlady\u2019s family","10246":"Soon enough, he falls in love with an English girl, Maud Osborne, who had been brought up in India","10247":"After a few misadventures, they eventually get married","10248":"Ghamat paints a picture where this interracial marriage helps mitigate the prejudices of many Englishmen and opens up possibilities for a more harmonious relationship between the races","10249":"In the novel, Ghamat also accurately depicts the political situation in India","10250":"He champions the cause of the Congress and attempts to expose the conservatives, many of them Parsis, who were misrepresenting its activities","10251":"With names such as Badmash Rao, Loocha Khan, Numskull Firebrand and Constancio Upright for his characters and Highhandabad and Contentpore for the locales, Ghamat infuses an element of satire in the narrative","10252":"Ghamat did not live long to enjoy any literary success his book might have had","10253":"He died on January 10, 1909, after a short bout of typhoid fever, which was then simultaneously raging in Bombay along with the plague","10254":"His book continued to be advertised for sale in the Times of India towards the end of the year, but without the earlier sensationalism: \"Depicts Indian political situation fully and gives a splendid idea of educated and advanced Parsi social life","10255":"Fully illustrated","10256":"Rs 1-8 only","10257":"Sold by all Booksellers","10258":"\"At about the same time when Ghamat\u2019s fictional hero Rustim was courting Maud Osborne, Ardeshir Chinoy went to London to study law","10259":"After having qualified as a barrister, he joined the High Court of Bombay on its administrative side, and in 1911, he was the Commissioner of its Affidavit Department","10260":"His wife Dinbai was one of many Parsi ladies whose writings began appearing in print at the turn of the century","10261":"Her first book, Kelvanina Pratap (The Power of Education) was published in 1904","10262":"After a decade, she published her next book, a Gujarati novel titled Mary Madam","10263":"Though I have not been able to lay my hands on the book, it is probable that Dinbai translated this novel from Gujarati into English with the help of her husband","10264":"It was published in London by the firm T Werner Laurie as Pootli, A Story of Life in Bombay in 1915","10265":"Though the title derives from the name of one of its characters, it could have been named after many others who feature equally prominently in the book","10266":"The Chinoys also explore the possibility of an interracial alliance in the novel","10267":"The arrogant Pootli, daughter of Rustomji Khanbahadur, is secretly engaged to be married to the flirtatious Jal","10268":"In turn, Jal fancies Lizzie Brown, the vivacious European tutor who teaches English, French and music to Pootli","10269":"Perhaps Lizzie Madam is the same character as Mary Madam from Dinbai\u2019s Gujarati novel, who ensnares the unsuspecting young Parsi man in her coils of love","10270":"When Jal discovers Lizzie\u2019s devious nature, he tries to wriggle out of the relationship but ends up being blackmailed by her","10271":"He steals his mother\u2019s jewellery and pawns it to meet Lizzie\u2019s demands","10272":"Just as he is on the path to reformation, Jal is suddenly seized by a fever","10273":"\"The doctor was not mistaken in his diagnosis, for when he called\n  again the same evening he observed all the unmistakable symptoms of\n  plague, which continues to claim every year its heavy toll of victims","10274":"The fever had gone high, delirium set in, the septic bubo made its\n  dreaded appearance, and altogether Jal\u2019s fate trembled in the\n  balance","10275":"\"In an implausible transformation, a repentant Lizzie turns into a volunteer nurse who ministers to the needs of her jilted lover","10276":"Jal seems to be on the path to recovery but is racked with guilt about the theft he has committed and eventually succumbs to the disease","10277":"The novel features other characters, such as orphans who \"were reduced to poverty and want by the sudden death of our parents, during the first outbreak of the deadly plague\"","10278":"In a sub-plot, the Chinoys also explore widow remarriage among the Hindus","10279":"Both the novels are profusely illustrated","10280":"Ghamat availed the services of the famous Bombay artist M V Dhurandhar, while the illustrator of Pootli remains anonymous","10281":"It would be easy to slight the pioneering literary efforts of Ghamat and the Chinoys","10282":"The Spectator of London dismissed Pootli in one sentence in its January 1916 issue: \"The authors of this novel may have a most accurate knowledge of life in Bombay, but they certainly cannot write good English","10283":"\" This is not unfair criticism","10284":"To a lesser degree, the same could be said of My Friend, The Barrister","10285":"The novel has a weak plot and Ghamat makes his characters mouth long speeches that he himself may have wanted to deliver","10286":"The plodding and predictable narrative, stilted dialogue, an unwieldy cast of characters with their one-dimensional characterisation would certainly not qualify the two novels as great works of literature even when they were published","10287":"However, after a hundred years, these early novels have acquired the gravitas of a rich historical source","10288":"Their depiction of upper-middle class life in suburban Bombay

billion Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) dues from consumers in 24 instalments but blocked further collection thereafter","10411":"The court ruled that application of the GIDC between 2011 and 2015 had accumulated a total amount of Rs700bn, specifically for three pipeline and infrastructure projects, out of which about Rs295bn had been collected and Rs405bn would be recovered now","10412":"Since the cost of these projects was less than Rs700bn, the objective of the cess had legally been achieved and its collection should come to an end at once, the court ruled","10413":"In a majority judgement of two-to-one, the three-judge bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam also cautioned the government that the levying of cess under the GIDC would be considered practically dead if work on the laying of three gas pipeline projects was not commenced immediately","10414":"The projects to be launched include the North-South pipelines within six months, TAPI pipelines as soon its laying in Afghanistan reaches the stage where the work of laying pipeline on Pakistan soil can conveniently start and the Iran-Pakistan pipeline as soon as the sanctions on Iran are no more an impediment in its laying","10415":"Orders that no further collection of cess from consumers will be madeAuthored by Justice Faisal Arab, the judgement said in case no work was carried out on North-South pipeline within the prescribed time and for laying any of the two other major pipelines though the political conditions became conducive, the purpose of levying cess would be deemed to have been frustrated and the GIDC Act, 2015 would become permanently in-operational and considered dead for all intents and purposes","10416":"The court however restrained the government from charging the cess under a power which would remain suspended until the cess-revenue collected and that which was accrued so far but not yet collected was spent on the projects listed in Section 4 of the GIDC Act, 2015 (the three projects)","10417":"In the remaining period of the financial year 2020-21 while considering fixation of sale price of CNG, Ogra and the government would not take into consideration the element of the cess under GIDC Act, 2015 as one of the cost of sale of GNG","10418":"The judgement held that the entire purpose of enacting GIDC Act, 2015 was to facilitate import of a very important source of energy i","10419":"e","10420":"natural gas \/ LNG from nearby countries to meet the ever expanding energy needs of the country since indigenous energy resources were fast depleting and the cheapest way to import was through overland transnational pipelines","10421":"Around Rs295bn had already been collected towards cess-revenue and together with the outstanding amount the total sum by the end of this month would be in the vicinity of Rs700bn, which was more than the estimated cost of the three projects, the court observed","10422":"The objective which the parliament had promised in the GIDC Act, 2015 was clearly \u2018purpose based\u2019 which was distinctly defined and carried with it an element of quid pro quo, making it a fee-imposing enactment instead of a pure revenue raising measure like taxes in general were imposed with no precondition attached for their spending, the judgement said","10423":"It said since all industrial and commercial entities which consumed gas for their business activities passed on the burden to their customers \/ clients therefore all arrears of the cess that had become due up to July 31, 2020 and had not been recovered so far would be recovered by the companies responsible under the GIDC Act 2015 from their consumers","10424":"But as a concession, the same be recovered in 24 equal monthly instalments starting from Aug 1, 2020 without the component of late payment surcharge","10425":"The late payment surcharge would only become payable for the delays that might occur in the payment of any of the 24 instalments, the judgement said","10426":"Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his dissenting note asked the government to return and refund the GIDC to the payers in full and constitute a committee to work out a mechanism for refund of GIDC, be it the gas consumers under the act or the final consumers (people of Pakistan)","10427":"Even if the gas consumers had passed on the fee to its customers, technology might be available to credit such customers, so that there was no unjust enrichment on the part of the state, the dissenting note said, adding that the amount of the GIDC that could not be refunded after exploring all other avenues, would remain earmarked and be utilised only for the infrastructure development of the gas sector","10428":"The judgement noted that a sum of Rs295bn was collected as the GIDC during the last almost 10 years","10429":"Keeping these facts in mind, and especially the issue of energy security, in the larger national interest, Justice Shah observed, the federal government should be given six months to initiate appropriate legislation in the light of the principles settled in this judgement, including a clear description of the services being rendered, provision of a reasonable timeline for the delivery of service (supply of natural gas) to the consumers and a statutory mechanism of obligations and consequences that might arise, if the service was delayed or was not delivered at all","10430":"In case the federal government fails to do so during this period, it will refund the amount of the GIDC","10431":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","10432":"THE point where the PML-N search engine rammed into the NAB wall in Lahore the other day is called Thokar for a reason","10433":"Thokar here probably signifies an abrupt rise in ground level, a jump that encouraged diversion of the river","10434":"It would take some imagination to liken the recent momentum of PML-N politics with the flow of a genuine, breathing river, but maybe it can be compared with the Ravi, the abandoned Iravati, which gave Lahore its lifeline and which has been the subject of some fancy civilisational schemes by the rulers since its tragic strangulation","10435":"The direction of the party cut off from its fountainhead Mian Nawaz Sharif has been as uncertain as that of a river that is supposed to have already run its course","10436":"As

out close to the NAB premises that morning","10438":"Three days later, Lahore is still trying to figure out what had actually happened during that clash","10439":"There are accusations and counter accusations and police cases","10440":"The reporters on the beat say NAB has another case now to summon and frustrate the PML-N stalwarts with","10441":"However, like most such cases, a truth which will satisfy even the most neutral souls will never be known","10442":"A few things are easy to assume","10443":"That a political party is inclined and fully entitled to having a show of strength as one of its leaders appears before the law in a high-profile case","10444":"That there is bound to be a display of unbridled sentiment at such an event, and there\u2019s this danger always of the emotion spilling over into the danger zone","10445":"The PML-N was torn between the urge to seize the moment and not irk the authorities beyond a certain limit","10446":"It is also expected at such moments of heightened political activity that a battery of top politicians belonging to the party will be there","10447":"Expectantly, each one of them will be jostling to be photographed with the prosecuted and persecuted leader","10448":"Also, usually the organisers have a fair idea how strong a demonstration they intend it to be","10449":"In this latest instance, it would again be unrealistic and actually apolitical to argue that anyone from the PML-N to the NAB, whose job as an accountability force ultimately is to make an example of the powerful, wanted it to be a quiet start of the week meeting","10450":"Both of them would have wanted to grab the headlines, but given the up-and-down intensity of the PML-N\u2019s tone, the message that filters through is that they discovered things to be a little overdone","10451":"That or there was a sudden change of heart and strategy by the PML-N after the violence involving its workers","10452":"It is clear that from a certain point onwards, the PML-N was torn between the urge to seize the moment for mass political capital and the old principle of not irking the authorities beyond a limit","10453":"The result showed up in a confused, halfhearted display of politics starring a long-promised new leader","10454":"Analysts, led by Punjab minister Fayyaz Chohan, said the gap between the politics of Mr Shahbaz Sharif and Ms Maryam Nawaz was there for everyone to see, and they were not wrong","10455":"What was worse for those who may have hoped for this to be some kind of a launching, finally, of Ms Maryam, was that Shahbaz Sharif still had a good presence","10456":"The misadventure at Thokar was proof of the dangerously impossible situations that defiant posturing could lead to","10457":"It was a confirmation that caution is the best policy","10458":"It seemed to be an error, a half measure and a scream suppressed by the unpopular fear that could cost any other political party","10459":"In this particular instance, it may have been shrugged off by some given the particular non-eccentric brand that is forever associated with the PML-N","10460":"But there are voices which say the change is a must and if Ms Maryam cannot bring in the necessary shifts who else can","10461":"It took her ages to emerge from behind the curtain","10462":"The longer she stayed away from public view the greater was the expectation naturally","10463":"The suspense cast her as someone who was included in the cast but whose entry was delayed for maximum impact","10464":"The hardcore PML-N cadres could not be faulted for believing that she was the crucial card in the pack that could take the game to a whole new level","10465":"It appears that Ms Maryam and her party have allowed the excitement created by the Thokar incident to fizzle out all too quickly","10466":"In fact, unlike some other opposition politicians, some of them even owing allegiance to the PML-N, Ms Maryam failed the important histrionics test","10467":"She came out as rather weak, and the footage of the whole episode betrayed that her grooming team appeared more prepared for the camera rather than the possibility of her having to break into an impassioned speech","10468":"There is this bit of information provided by a most reliable journalist in Lahore who says Ms Maryam was constantly taking directions from Mian Nawaz Sharif","10469":"With an experienced coach like her dad there\u2019s little room for anyone else offering her any advice, barring perhaps asking her: what is it actually that she aims to do","10470":"Pakistanis have spent so much time and energy trying to dissuade people such as Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari from taking in-family counsel seriously","10471":"Perhaps Thokar on Aug 10, 2020, could have unveiled a new independent-thinking, a touch rebellious, a wee bit angry new leader worth wooing","10472":"","10473":"","10474":"As usual the groove is just too comfortable for the family

some cheer","10811":"The pall of gloom that descended on the country with the start of the lockdowns on March 24 has now begun to lift and there is good reason to expect that the sun is rising after those dark days","10812":"It is premature to say that the danger is now behind us, and it would be reckless to lower our guard at this point","10813":"Also read: Viral verdictBut the signs are unmistakable","10814":"The virus is now receding, and even if the official numbers are understating the spread of the infection, or the deaths resulting from it, that still does not negate the fact that the virus has not wrought the kind of widespread catastrophe that we were bracing ourselves for in the early days","10815":"It has been 155 days since the first confirmed cases were detected in the country on Feb 26, and where the models were telling us the death toll could approach 100,000 by now, we have lost 5,892 people (as per the official count)","10816":"Of course, each of those lives is precious, but on this occasion we should thank the Almighty that we have been spared the kind of catastrophe that others \u2014 like Brazil, the US, UK, Spain, Italy and so many more \u2014 have had to face","10817":"Also read: Govt probing causes of decline in Covid-19 deathsThe days to come will offer plenty of opportunity to dissect and explore the reasons why our country, along with many

spared the kind of catastrophe that others have had to face on the Covid-19 front","10819":"Many among us will no doubt attribute it to the \u2018smart lockdown\u2019 policy adopted by the government, and they are welcome to it, and if they are right then we should all be grateful","10820":"But we will have to wait for an answer to the question","10821":"After all, even after those days when the lockdowns were largely lifted and the SOPs were clearly not being followed, such as the last days of Ramazan and the run-up to the Eid shopping season, we saw a spike in cases afterwards, but even that spike did not rise to catastrophic levels","10822":"It levelled out far sooner than what the models were telling us","10823":"Undoubtedly, some sort of X factor has been at play in many countries that has mitigated the virulence of the infection, curbing its spread as well as its lethality, and I am sure all my readers will join me in offering up a prayer of deep gratitude to our Creator that we are among those countries","10824":"Deaths from the virus per million population peaked in Belgium at 848 followed by the UK at 676 where the world average at the moment is 85","10825":"Just look at the numbers from the other countries: Spain 608, Chile 583, Italy 581, Peru 564, Sweden 564, the US 460, Brazil 417, Netherlands 359 and so on","10826":"By contrast in Pakistan, the figure stands at 27","10827":"Now we can say that this is understated because the testing rate has gone down, or that people are not going to hospitals to avoid the stigma, or that deaths are not being registered as Covid-19 deaths but attributed to some other cause in an effort to bring down the numbers","10828":"But no matter how you cut it, you cannot get around the fact that this number is low, in fact, far lower than anything we imagined at the start of the whole affair","10829":"You can triple this number to correct for underreporting bias, and you still won\u2019t reach the world average, let alone the catastrophic numbers that many others saw, including Iran (194)","10830":"It is possible to understate the deaths up to a point","10831":"But if you do it past a certain threshold, other data points will betray you","10832":"If we had a low reported death rate, but hospitals were issuing death certificates at a rapid pace and ICUs were full of patients struggling to breathe, we could say \u2018what\u2019s going on","10833":"\u2019 and begin to doubt the official fatality figures the government was putting out","10834":"If the hospitals have been emptied out because patients are being turned away (unlikely, but let\u2019s assume for a minute nonetheless), the graveyards would be seeing a surge in the number of bodies being brought for burial","10835":"There is some increase in graveyard data in June, but nothing that points towards a widespread death toll of the likes in Iran or the other countries mentioned here","10836":"In fact, a widespread, unreported death toll would most likely become visible and be impossible to conceal after a while, given today\u2019s communication technologies","10837":"Consider a few other countries that are also reporting low fatality rates from the virus","10838":"If we are at 27 (per million), Costa Rica has 25, Nigeria four, Ghana five, Morocco nine, Kenya six, Nepal two, Sri Lanka 0","10839":"5, Mali six, Cuba eight, Libya and Congo 10, Somalia six and so on","10840":"A very large number of countries have reported very small death counts from the virus","10841":"Pakistan is not alone in this group","10842":"You could argue that these countries are all understating their death counts","10843":"I have not looked at their testing rates or criteria or whether they have reported spikes in deaths from other morbidities in the same time period, factors that might point towards them all underreporting their death counts","10844":"And frankly I\u2019m not going to","10845":"The burden of proof is now on those who wish to doubt these numbers","10846":"They now have to explain why the numbers are so low, and if they believe there is widespread underreporting, it is they who have to unearth the proof to establish their argument","10847":"Of course, the real number of fatalities is higher than what is being reported, but not by the order of magnitude required to even bring them to the global average, let alone come close to the levels reported by those who were devastated by the virus\u2019s impact","10848":"So on this Eid let us take some cheer that we seem to have been spared our worst fears","10849":"Let us spare a prayer for those mourning and remembering loved ones on this blessed occasion","10850":"Let us resolve to keep our guard and face the future with a renewed sense of optimism","10851":"Things are getting better, dear reader","10852":"May the clouds part sooner rather than later, and may the Almighty shower his blessings upon you and your loved ones in the days and years to

player signed to deliver PSG its most coveted trophy spared the French champions from a humbling Champions League exit against Atalanta","10949":"A night of frustrating squandered scoring chances ended with Neymar setting up the goals that turned Wednesday\u2019s game around, producing a 2-1 victory that sent PSG into the semi-finals for the first time in 25 years","10950":"\u201cNobody will ever get it out of my head that I want to go to the final,\u201d he said","10951":"\u201cWe\u2019re a formidable squad, a family, with the attitude that it\u2019s impossible to knock us out","10952":"\u201dAtalanta, the Serie A club on a modest budget eclipsed by Qatar-funded PSG, had led from Mario Pasalic\u2019s curling strike in the 27th minute until the 90th","10953":"Neymar then found time to set up Marquinhos for the equaliser and was involved in the build-up to Eric Choupo-Moting\u2019s winner in the third minute of stoppage time","10954":"Relief for Neymar","10955":"Agony for Atalanta","10956":"And all the emotions could be heard around the empty Lisbon stadium, with no fans allowed inside because of the coronavirus restrictions","10957":"\u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s quite painful,\u201d Atalanta midfielder Marten de Roon said","10958":"\u201cTomorrow, I will be proud of our team and club but at this moment I feel disappointment","10959":"\u201dThe result is heartbreaking for Atalanta, who were hoping to continue their fairytale campaign for at least a few more days and give the people of Bergamo more reason to cheer","10960":"The northern Italian city suffered terribly at the height of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year","10961":"Bergamo\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 has made it one of the worst-hit regions anywhere during the health crisis","10962":"\u201cIt leaves us with a very bad taste to have conceded that late winner when the match was about to finish,\u201d Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said","10963":"\u201cThat\u2019s what is really hurting us because until that moment we thought we were controlling the match","10964":"\u201d This will still go down as a highly successful season for Gasperini\u2019s team, who scored eight goals over two legs to beat Valencia in the last 16 in March","10965":"That tie was completed just before football across Europe ground to a halt in the face of the pandemic, but Atalanta have since come back to finish third in Serie A for the second year running, scoring 98 goals in the process","10966":"Beating PSG was ultimately a step too far, but that Atalanta came so close is remarkable enough","10967":"After all, their annual wage bill is believed to be equivalent to what PSG pay Neymar alone","10968":"The substitutes helped transform PSG\u2019s fortunes first with Kylian Mbappe\u2019s arrival with 30 minutes remaining, and then Choupo-Moting 20 minutes later","10969":"When I came on, I thought to myself, \u2018We can\u2019t lose, we can\u2019t go home like that","10970":"\u2019 I was confident in myself, confident in the team and then the rest is the history of Paris,\u201d said Cameroon international Choupo-Moting, whose high, diagonal pass reached Neymar on the left flank in the 90th","10971":"\u2018The Brazilian\u2019s scuffed shot was turned in by Marquinhos to rouse PSG for a thrilling finale","10972":"It was another run by Neymar that unpicked a tiring Atalanta before feeding Mbappe, who squared across for Choupo-Moting to slide the ball over the line","10973":"\u201cIt was not only just a technical show,\u201d Choupo-Moting said of Neymar","10974":"\u201cHe has worked hard for the team","10975":"\u201d Although Neymar was awarded man of the match, the 222 million forward handed over the prize to the less glamorous teammate signed as a free agent two year ago after Stoke City\u2019s relegation from the Premier League","10976":"Only the season being extended because of the pandemic means Choupo-Moting is still a PSG player","10977":"The pandemic also meant the quarter-finals are not being played on a home-and-away basis as usual but as single games in neutral Lisbon with no second chances","10978":"With Ligue 1 abandoned in March, PSG had only played two competitive games since then domestic cup final victories in July","10979":"\u201cIt was very difficult to prepare the team,\u201d PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said","10980":"\u201cThere was no rhythm because there were no games, but I could feel in the last days the determination, enthusiasm and effort","10981":"\u201d Choupo-Moting went on in the 79th to replace the struggling Mauro Icardi, who managed just a single off-target shot","10982":"At least Neymar was getting in sight of goal more often, but scuffed several good chances in the first half including a glaring miss in the third minute","10983":"Receiving possession on the halfway line, he ran half the length of the pitch and had only goalkeeper Marco Sportiello to beat but skewed the ball wide of the post","10984":"The misses proved costly when Duvan Zapata\u2019s pass caught PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe and fell to Pasalic, who curled into the roof of the net for his 12th goal of the season","10985":"Once again, PSG looked to Neymar to find a way back into the game","10986":"Once again, he missed, dragging a shot wide and looking like a player who has only had two competitive games since March","10987":"Even a free kick from Neymar lacked any pace and was easily saved","10988":"And when right back Hans Hateboer gifted Neymar an opening in the 42nd with a sloppy back pass, the forward could only strike wide","10989":"Mbappe was only introduced for the final half hour, having just recovered from an ankle injury, but he was also frustrated in front of goal","10990":"Still, the star duo of Neymar and Mbappe made an impact by acting as the support cast, creating the goals that kept PSG on course for a first European Cup to add to this season\u2019s domestic trophies","10991":"PSG will play Atletico Madrid or RB Leipzig in the semi-finals on Tuesday","10992":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","10993":"LAHORE: Lahore

the personal mobiles and technical gadgets of government officials and military personnel\"","11003":"The statement added that various targets of \"hostile intelligence agencies\" were being investigated","11004":"Pakistan Army has enhanced necessary measures to thwart such activities, including action against violators of standard operating procedures on cyber security, it added","11005":"\"An advisory is also being sent to all government departments\/ institutions for identifying lapses and enhancing respective cyber security measures,\" the ISPR said","11006":"On July

LoC,\" ISPR Director General Major General Babar Iftikhar had said in a tweet, adding that this was the tenth Indian quadcopter to be shot down by Pakistan Army troops this year","11008":"For decades, the word \"pandemic\" occupied a little-visited suburb of the English language","11009":"Obscure researchers, doctors with a death wish, and doomsday theorists scribbled about it in journals bought by few and read by even fewer","11010":"Then, in a matter of weeks this year, \"pandemic\" made its way to the smartest and costliest digs in town","11011":"So far in 2020, the term has been included in every other news report, bandied about in op-eds in all sorts of publications, punned about on social media, and tossed around like a football by ten-year-olds","11012":"In 2020, \"pandemic\" went, well, viral","11013":"First recorded in the 1660s, the word comes from the Latin \"pandemus\", which in turn comes from the Greek \"pandemos\": \"pan\" meaning \"all, every, whole\", and \"demos\" meaning \"the people\", specifically, the people of ancient Greek states","11014":"The connection of \"demos\" to \"democracy\" is not difficult to decipher","11015":"As for \"epidemic\" \u2014 the Greek word \"epi\" means \"on\" \u2014 it may have first been used by Homer","11016":"Hippocrates adopted it later as the title of one of his famous treatises","11017":"At that time, epidemic was the name given to a collection of clinical syndromes, such as coughs or diarrhoeas, spreading over a given period at one location","11018":"Over the centuries, the meaning of the term changed","11019":"After the repeated outbreaks of plague in the Middle Ages, \"epidemic\" came to be understood as the propagation of a single, well-defined disease","11020":"Based on available evidence, it can be concluded that \"pandemic\" entered the English language later than \"epidemic\"","11021":"Thomas Lodge\u2019s A Treatise of the Plague, published in 1603, talks of the \"Epidemick plague\" as a \"common and popular sicknesse, hapning in some region, or countrey, at a certaine time\"","11022":"The word \"pandemic\", essentially an epidemic spread over a wider geographical area, appears to have been modelled after \"epidemic\"","11023":"Both seem to come from the same etymological roots","11024":"The word \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" come from the name for a pox virus \u2014 the cowpox virus orvaccinia","11025":"An apocryphal story holds that in the late 1770s, Edward Jenner, the physician who developed the small pox vaccine, heard a Bristol milkmaid boast, \"I shall never have smallpox for I have had cowpox","11026":"I shall never have an ugly pockmarked face","11027":"\"Intrigued, Jenner investigated further and came to the conclusion that the milkmaid was right","11028":"Milkmaids infected with cowpox, which appeared as a series of pustules on the hands and forearms, were immune to smallpox epidemics that regularly attacked others","11029":"In 1796, Jenner gave a patient what came to be known as the first \"vaccinia vaccine\" \u2014 that is, a vaccine made from the cowpox virus","11030":"Jenner\u2019s vaccination soon became the major means of preventing smallpox around the world","11031":"From the manger has also emerged another oft-heard word in these days: \"herd\", used in the context of immunity","11032":"\"Herd\" comes from the Old English \"heord\" meaning a \"flock, company of domestic animals\"","11033":"Interestingly, \"herd\" is connected to the Sanskrit \"\u015b\u00e1rdhah\", which also means flock","11034":"This connection is a pointer to the common roots of Sanskrit and English, both of which belong to the Indo-European language family \u2014 and whose ancestor, what linguists call \"Proto Indo-European\" (PIE), is a language from the distant past","11035":"The original PIE word, some linguists suggest, is likely to have been \"kerdh\", from which flowed the Sanskrit and English words","11036":"\"Immunity\", though, is not of animal stock","11037":"It appears to descend from the Old French \"immunit\u00e9\", meaning \"exemption from service or obligation\", which itself comes from the Latin \"immunitatem\", meaning \"exemption from performing public service or charge, privilege\"","11038":"The medical sense of immunity as \"protection from disease\" has been dated back to 1879, when Louis Pasteur developed the science of immunisation in the process of studying a disease that affected chickens (known as \"chicken cholera\") and accidentally \"immunised\" some chickens to the disease","11039":"He went on to develop vaccines for anthrax and rabies, and is regarded as the father of immunology","11040":"The current pandemic, of course, harks back to the devastating outbreak of plague in the middle ages","11041":"Around 1350, officials in the Venetian-controlled port city of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) passed a law establishing what they termed \"trentino\", derived from the Italian trenta meaning \"thirty\" \u2014 a 30-day period of isolation for ships that had arrived from plague-affected areas","11042":"No one was allowed to visit the ships under \"trentino\"","11043":"Offenders were punished by also being isolated for the mandatory 30 days","11044":"This practice of isolation soon became commonplace, with Marseilles, Pisa, and various other cities also adopting the practice","11045":"Within a century, cities had extended the isolation period from 30 to 40 days, and the term changed from \"trentino\" to \"quarantine\", derived from the Italian \"quaranta\" meaning forty","11046":"This is the root of the word \"quarantine\" that rolls off our tongue today","11047":"A spinoff of \"quarantine\" that has gained currency since April 2020 is \"Quentin Quarantino\"","11048":"The Urban Dictionary defines it thus: \"When you are advised to quarantine due to a world-wide crisis, are extremely bored, stuck indoors and your social media movie making skills are in full effect","11049":"\"Given the prolonged nature of the pandemic, \"cabin fever\" might well become an accepted malady of sorts \u2014 acceptable enough as a reason to shirk that irksome Zoom call","11050":"This word appears to have originated in the US, perhaps in the late 19th or early 20th century","11051":"The isolation that those who \"went West\" towards the Great Plains suffered during the long winter months, with virtually no company at hand, is the likely origin of this term","11052":"It probably referred to a type of claustrophobia that the isolation brought on","11053":"Not incidentally, the word \"isolation\", too, comes from a medical context closely connected to the plague epidemic","11054":"The first permanent hospital for treating plague victims was established in Venice in 1423 on a nearby island called Santa Maria di Nazaret","11055":"The patients were in a manner of speaking \"islanded\" (or in \"isolato\" in Italian, which comes from \"insula\", meaning \"island\" in Latin), which explains how the term made its way to English","11056":"Every once in a while, words burst into public consciousness","11057":"As linguists will tell you, this is rather unusual","11058":"Usually, words flow into languages organically, often from other languages through repeated usage over a long period of time","11059":"Sometimes, they are coined by people, introduced and then adopted in a gradual fashion, again over a fairly lengthy period of time","11060":"But in some instances, words enter vocabularies with a bang","11061":"Quite literally","11062":"Prior to \"pandemic\", nothing illustrates this better than the way the word \"tsunami\" invaded the world\u2019s consciousness on December 26, 2004","11063":"Before that day, \"tsunami\" was a trivia question, recognised by some as the Japanese word for \"tidal wave\" or \"harbour wave\"","11064":"A few others identified it as the subject of a famous woodblock print by Katsushika Hokusai, copies of which have long adorned Western homes","11065":"But since the 2004 tsunami, the term has also come to mean a cataclysmic change that significantly alters the nature of reality","11066":"The 2008 financial crisis was thus characterised as a \"financial tsunami\"","11067":"After the worldwide lockdown, the term \"digital tsunami\" has also been widely used by business analysts to describe the unavoidable shift to a digital-only work-from-home scenario prompted by the pandemic","11068":"This article was first published in Scroll","11069":"in and has been reproduced with permission","11070":"K-Electric CEO Moonis Alvi can see the light in the darkness","11071":"Quite literally","11072":"\u201cI was coming from Islamabad that night","11073":"Karachi lit up brightly as the plane started its descent","11074":"It looked beautiful,\u201d he said about the night in the last week of July when Karachi received torrential rain in record time and the city, according to everyone and her aunt, plunged into darkness for hours on end","11075":"Alvi insisted that only 40-50 feeders remained shut for more than six hours that night","11076":"\u201cOut of the total of 1,860 feeders, only 80-90 were off at the time (of descent),\u201d he said, implying that more than 95 per cent of the distribution network was up and running within a few hours of the heaviest rain the city has recorded in recent years","11077":"K-Electric CEO says loadshedding is an outcome of the federal government\u2019s flip-flops on key issuesIn a wide-ranging interview with Dawn last week in his office, the mild-mannered CEO of Karachi\u2019s sole power distribution company was downright dismissive of unflattering anecdotal evidence","11078":"An accountant by training, Alvi showed unassailable faith in the supremacy of numbers in his ledger","11079":"He made light of the public outcry over loadshedding","11080":"It is \u2018noise,\u2019 not signal","11081":"The disgruntled few outspeak the satisfied many","11082":"Electricity demand in Karachi peaked in the second week of July","11083":"It hit 3,600 megawatts but has since come down to around 3,300MW","11084":"Being a vertically integrated company, KE is solely responsible for generating, transmitting and selling electricity in Karachi and neighbouring towns","11085":"After accounting for the output of its own generation plants and electricity obtained from the national grid and independent power producers, KE can supply up to a maximum of 3,200MW to its consumers under the best conditions","11086":"So how did the power utility fail to anticipate demand despite being around since 2005 when it shed its old skin and was born anew under private ownership","11087":"The blame lies with the government, according to the KE CEO","11088":"\u201cWe knew even in 2014-15 that there would be a deficit in 2020","11089":"That\u2019s why we conceived a number of projects like a 900MW RLNG plant, a 700MW coal project and another 450MW RLNG project in collaboration with Engro","11090":"\u201dThe coal plant received approval, but the government then had afterthoughts","11091":"It insisted that the plant should run on local coal instead of imported one","11092":"KE redrew the entire plan and went back to the government for approval","11093":"But the government changed its mind for the second time","11094":"It asked KE to shelve the project for good","11095":"The government had already commissioned too much electricity elsewhere in the country","11096":"So it wanted KE to buy excess capacity in the national grid from the federal government\u2013owned National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC)","11097":"\u201cWe had planned for self-sufficiency","11098":"But the 900MW plant was delayed by two years for tariff reasons, the 700MW plant was shelved and the Engro plant was also put aside owing to excess capacity","11099":"If we were allowed to stick to the original plans, we would have sufficient electricity today even after relinquishing 650MW that we get from the federal government,\u201d he said","11100":"The government gave formal approval for evacuating excess energy from NTDC in June","11101":"KE expects to start doing it next year","11102":"Will 2021 be any different","11103":"The answer depends on Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to a large extent, Alvi says","11104":"It\u2019s supplying low-pressure gas, which makes it inefficient to run power plants","11105":"Half of the current supply-demand gap of 400MW can be bridged overnight only if SSGC ensured the right level of pressure, he said","11106":"But he cannot do anything about it because KE has no formal fuel purchase agreement with SSGC","11107":"The power sector regulator does not accept this excuse though","11108":"KE cannot be absolved of the negative impact that this underutilisation has on the consumer tariff, the regulator has said, because ensuring fuel availability is its own responsibility","11109":"\u201cIn the next seven to eight months, we will resolve the gas pressure issue even if we have to install new equipment or a new line,\u201d Alvi said","11110":"Projections are that peak demand in Karachi will touch 3,900MW next year","11111":"KE\u2019s current system can supply 3,000MW under normal circumstances","11112":"It expects to add another 300MW from the national grid","11113":"Separately, the company will shut down two of its old plants and add a new one, resulting in a net increase of 250-270MW","11114":"It means the total net addition to the KE system will be 550-570MW next year","11115":"Accounting for about 70MW from wind power plants and another 70MW from Kanupp, the KE system is expected to have around 3,700MW in 2021","11116":"This will still be 200MW short of peak demand","11117":"The power sector regulator reserved some stinging criticism for the company in one of its latest reports","11118":"\u201cHistorical record shows that KE underutilised its power plants whereas it continued to carry out loadshedding,\u201d said National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) in its recently released state of the industry report for 2019","11119":"In 2018-19, the latest period for which the company\u2019s financials are available, KE\u2019s net profit amounted to Rs17","11120":"2billion, up 40","11121":"3pc from a year ago","11122":"Yet the ratio of cash flow from operations to revenue remained negative, which means it\u2019s unable to turn its sales into usable hard cash","11123":"Meanwhile, KE\u2019s cash flow from financing activities rose by 761pc over the same period","11124":"This shows the company resorted to massive leverage \u2014 increasing debt as opposed to equity \u2014 to stay liquid","11125":"\u201cThe government has not paid us tariff differential claims since July 2016,\u201d Alvi retorted","11126":"But KE too has withheld payments to NTDC","11127":"Its current liabilities jumped 43","11128":"4pc in 2018-19 to Rs295","11129":"3bn","11130":"\u201cThey owe us Rs240bn and we owe them Rs170bn","11131":"KE should get Rs70bn if liabilities and receivables are netted off","11132":"We had to finance that gap by borrowing,\u201d he said","11133":"Turnaround story","11134":"Some commentators hail KE as a turnaround story","11135":"But many key performance indicators of KE don\u2019t bear comparison with those of state-owned distribution companies","11136":"For example, KE\u2019s recovery ratio was 92","11137":"6pc in 2018-19 as opposed to distribution companies of Multan (99","11138":"35pc), Faisalabad (99","11139":"3pc) and Lahore (97","11140":"7)","11141":"Similarly, KE\u2019s transmission and distribution losses (T&D) were also higher than those of many state-owned Discos","11142":"Average daily loadshedding by KE in 2018-19 was 1","11143":"77 hours, higher than that by Discos of Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala and Islamabad","11144":"In terms of the number of consumer service complaints, KE was once again at the top even though it\u2019s not the largest player","11145":"\u201cI don\u2019t know why these companies are posting losses if they have such fantastic recovery ratios and low T&D losses,\u201d Alvi said, implying some financial sleight of hand","11146":"The jury may still be out on whether consumers are better off with KE in private hands, but the verdict is loud and clear for its investors","11147":"They seem to have mistaken the map for the territory at a heavy cost","11148":"The company has reinvested all its profits amounting to Rs125bn since 2012","11149":"There has been neither dividends nor share price appreciation","11150":"Their consistent attempt to sell the company to Shanghai Electric Power has been unsuccessful since 2016","11151":"\u201cSponsors wanted to sell it for $1","11152":"88bn in 2016-17","11153":"That would translate into an 8pc return on investment, which wasn\u2019t very high,\u201d Alvi conceded","11154":"Hesitatingly speaking on the issue, he added the price will be lower than the earlier one now because of a sharp change in the exchange rate","11155":"The company claims to have invested $2","11156":"4bn since 2009 and intends to invest another $3bn in the next four years","11157":"Going by these numbers, the expected selling price looks underwhelming","11158":"Alvi reservedly agreed","11159":"\u201cOur new 900MW plant alone is worth $650m","11160":"In addition to that, our capex (capital expenditure) in 2020 is Rs30bn, which means another $160m","11161":"\u201dKE\u2019s holding company is KES Power, an offshore entity registered in the Cayman Islands","11162":"The doomed private equity fund Abraaj Capital held a majority stake in the offshore company until recently","11163":"But its name appears to have been airbrushed from the company\u2019s history after its CEO was arrested last year for misappropriating investors\u2019 funds","11164":"\u201cAbraaj Capital acted only as a management company","11165":"Investors actually

to replenish sales","11187":"Punjab also increased the numbers \u2014 from 260 last year to 303 this year \u2014 of these trading hubs to spread the load and made them observe all pandemic protocols: conducting corona tests of sellers, taking the temperature of visitors and ensuring gloves and sanitisers at the entry points","11188":"Mathematical measurements were brought in for ensuring a safe space for animals and purchasers","11189":"For the first time, Punjab has seen animals costing Rs1","11190":"5m-2m in its Eid marketsAs additional measures, the provincial government not only launched an application to facilitate online trade but also encouraged potential traders and purchasers to go online","11191":"According to the managers of the official app, over 10,000 people had downloaded it till a week before Eid and over 500 animals were traded on it","11192":"The trend, they were sure, will gather pace in the run-up to the Eid day","11193":"In addition, organisations like the United States Agency for International Development also started portals to keep people off the market and many private brands also started online services \u2014 turning the ritual into online activity, albeit partially","11194":"Even religious parties like Jamaat-e-Islami (through its subsidiary Al-Khidmat Foundation) went online for booking, collection of animals and hide gatherings","11195":"The trade watchers and brands managers believe that this trend will now hold, even when the virus has dwindled away because of a number of benefits","11196":"There is no hassle of purchasing and keeping animals for days, looking for a butcher \u2014 a time taking and expensive annoyance \u2014 and finally, the safe deposit of offal is ensured","11197":"People will now get cleanly prepared meat at their doorsteps, ready for distribution","11198":"Most of those involved in the activity think that this trend will not only stay but will gather strength in the coming years","11199":"Slowing down of national and personal economy due to the pandemic has impacted trade in more than one way","11200":"It has not only slowed down general trade but also changed its nature","11201":"In Punjab, historically people preferred smaller animals for individual slaughtering","11202":"However, a small shift was noted last year: as people\u2019s economy started slowing down, they started opting for the bigger animals for collective sacrifice rather than going for an individual one","11203":"This year, this smaller shift has turned into a massive trend","11204":"Zubair Wattu, in-charge of Lahore markets, thinks that the sale of the bigger animal may jump by 30 per cent this year if the trend noted early in the season holds till Eid","11205":"\u201cIt is simple economics: a goat now costs around Rs30,000 to Rs35,000, whereas sharing costs anything between Rs15,000 to Rs20,000","11206":"So, people are going for bigger animals in a big way","11207":"Last year, out of 6","11208":"2m animals, around two million were bigger ones","11209":"This year, the figure may go to three million \u2014 changing the dynamics of the trade","11210":"\u201d Another trend, which is new for Punjab is the introduction of exotic animals in the Eid trade","11211":"\u201cIt has been there in Karachi markets, but for Punjab, it is new and healthy,\u201d says Talat Naseer Pasha \u2014 former vice-chancellor of the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences","11212":"For the first time, Punjab has seen animals costing Rs1","11213":"5-2m in its Eid markets","11214":"Online sales, if social media is to be believed, went as high as five to six million rupees per animal","11215":"According to livestock traders, this is the culmination of a trait called animal fattening, which started some five years ago in Punjab","11216":"During the first half of the decade, at least 25 high-investment modern farms came up, which are now fattening animals, making them look better and increasing their visual appeal and claiming premium prices","11217":"So far, the sales were restricted to individual farms","11218":"But now, as expected, they are exploring Eid markets","11219":"As these farms spread throughout the province, carrying news of exceptionally high-price spread, even smaller farmers started nurturing their animals on the same lines with better diets based on fats and proteins","11220":"\u201cIt is always good to have a premium market, elite breeds and exotic animals as they represent better raising practices and improve the supply chain","11221":"They are the trendsetters that raise the benchmark and improve the entire trade activity,\u201d says VC Pasha","11222":"Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, August 4th, 2020","11223":"While the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc indiscriminately in all parts of the world, it has had a ten-fold impact in most under developed countries and their large populations, paralysing already tottering health and welfare systems","11224":"In Pakistan, the outbreak is believed to have caused an economic slowdown that amounts to a staggering loss of Rs2","11225":"5 trillion, with about three million jobs likely to be lost at the very beginning; worst affected out of the country's total population are the daily wage earners and those who inhabit the unforgiving urban slums","11226":"For years, Pakistan's local charities have been playing a key role in stemming the economic burden on the government by providing meals, medical assistance and other key services to low-income groups","11227":"In a bid to help further their cause during these challenging times, PepsiCo, along with the organisation's philanthropic wing, PepsiCo Foundation, vowed to extend support for these charitable organisations as part of their 'Million of Meals' initiative","11228":"The idea was to empower millions of dreams, disrupt millions of stereotypes, travel millions of miles to reach all corners of the country, and line millions of spreads, with a vision of providing immediate emergency disaster relief for the many vulnerable, neglected parts of Pakistan","11229":"As Covid-19 reduced access to food and other essential goods for communities around the world, PepsiCo invested more than $60 million globally, and catalysed an additional $59 million in funding from others to bring food and other vital resources to the most affected communities","11230":"The company is also providing funding for protective gear for healthcare workers, testing and screening services, and is in the process of distributing more than 100 million nutritious meals globally to at-risk populations","11231":"In Pakistan, within two months of launch, the initiative has served over 10 million meals with the help of some of the country's most lauded charities in Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir","11232":"Lending a hand to the government of Pakistan, PepsiCo has promised over $1","11233":"4 million worth of meals and a collaboration with Prime Minister's Ehsaas Rashan Portal, which is run under the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division","11234":"All this was not possible without the passion, determination and drive of hundreds of volunteers, PepsiCo associates, workers and support staff, who came together from every corner of Pakistan to lend a hand to the forgotten, the ignored, and the marginalised","11235":"Apart from millions of meals, there were also millions of stories","11236":"Let's hear them","11237":"Empowering minority groups that are often misrepresented and marginalised in a country marred by hunger and poverty is a tough job","11238":"Add to that a global health emergency like the coronavirus outbreak and the magnitude of the challenge increases tenfold","11239":"Supported by PepsiCo, Orange Tree Foundation took on the responsibility of reaching out to thousands of vulnerable households and transgender communities in Sindh; in Thatta and Badin, Baba and Bhit Islands, Mubarak village, and in Banaras, Orangi Town, Lyari, and other neglected parts of Karachi","11240":"The organisation managed this with the help of over 50 volunteers, including a dedicated team of community reps belonging to the transgender and fisherman community","11241":"Life in Karachi's busy Port area waits for nothing, and acknowledges no one","11242":"People like Abdul Razzak know that all too well","11243":"For the inhabitants of Shams Pir village in Bhit Island, Razzak is no less than a saint; this also why they often call him Haji Razzak","11244":"Talking about the many struggles of the fishermen and their families at Baba and Bhit Island, Razzak told us, \"80% of these people are so poor that they cannot afford any meals","11245":"Their debts are huge and there is no one coming for help","11246":"No matter what problems they go through, the people here know they can knock at Razzak bhai's door at any time of the day","11247":"I do all that I can to help these people earn a living","11248":"\"A senior volunteer, Hanif Majeed, for Orange Tree Foundation and its cause, is a heroic frontliner who did not hesitate in facilitating the relief drive even in the challenging times of the coronavirus","11249":"For days, Hanif would run around and personally pack and distribute meals in different areas","11250":"Facing numerous unprecedented challenges posed by these tough pandemic times, it was Hanif who would get up as early as 6am and continue distribution of meals at Baba and Bhit Islands till late in the night, without a break or even a hint of a frown","11251":"Such is the warmth exhibited by these heroes of Pakistan who know they might remain unrecognised for life, for they seek nothing but smiles and kindness in return","11252":"Speaking for Karachi's much ignored transgender community, Zehrish has high hopes from a city that honours nothing but privilege","11253":"She believes people can help their community dispel stereotypes, and that alone will empower them enough to find the right job opportunities, the acceptance and social inclusion they've always dreamed of - and some day, the parents who abandoned them","11254":"Zehrish led OTF's team to Karachi's Safoora goth, Pehlwan goth, Sachal goth, Bin Qasim Pipri, Baldia town, and Saadullah goth near Hub chauki","11255":"Speaking to us about the condition of her community, Zehrish says, \"People have experienced isolation now, but we were born in it","11256":"We have no jobs and no houses in the urban, more developed parts of the city","11257":"A ton of us are educated and equipped with the right skills to help boost Pakistan's economy, but no one is ready to let us work","11258":"\"Zehrish assisted the Orange Tree Foundation in serving millions of meals to the lockdown-struck underprivileged transgender community that awaits nothing but a little compassion and social inclusion","11259":"My mother was told to abandon me when I was born with a physical disability","11260":"But she said, no","11261":"She said, my son will not be a burden, and will grow to make something out of himself and represent people like him","11262":"I am here, volunteering for this meal distribution drive, because I feel uneasy when they say I am good for nothing","11263":"People like me do not get the same amount of respect or space as other family members","11264":"I was surprised to see so many disabled persons show up at the distribution point despite the many challenges of commute, lack of support from family, and stereotypes we experience in everyday life","11265":"Zulfiqar Ali played an active role as a community rep and volunteer; he represented disabled people of his community and also gave the team valuable insights on the social dynamics of Sujawal","11266":"Reaching faraway, neglected areas of Balochistan, People\u2019s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) is running meal distribution drives in two phases; phase one focused on Killa Abdulla, Panjgoor, Lasbella, Quetta, and Jaffarabad, and phase two aims to include an additional 28 different districts","11267":"With each office deploying 10-15 staffers, PPHI was able to address the many challenges that stood in the way; the biggest being identification of beneficiaries via community support groups and district administration","11268":"Widows and mothers of four and six respectively, Sherbano and Bibi Ruksana's struggle began as a startled, pandemic-hit Pakistan was locked down earlier this year","11269":"After the death of her husband, who was a daily wager, Bibi Ruksana worked in the fields of BHU Segai to earn her daily income; the area is known as a disputed territory faced with multiple tribal issues, which make it hard to transport goods and commute in the township","11270":"Upon receiving the support she needed, Bibi cheered and said she will ensure that the supplies last long enough for her household to survive the lockdown, and hopefully the pandemic","11271":"At the brink of a nationwide lockdown earlier this year, inhabitants of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,  Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir had a challenging question at hand: will there be food on the tables if their towns are shut indefinitely","11272":"Stretched across Pakistan's most breathtaking landscapes, the provinces offer unparalleled peace, beauty and warmth to their inhabitants, but limited opportunities of safe and sustainable income; most underprivileged people here are pushed to survive on daily wages, with scarce resources to counter difficult living conditions","11273":"To reach out to these communities, organisations like Al-Khidmat, Mehnaz Fatima Foundation and National Rural Support Program (NRSP) stepped forward","11274":"Since most of these households are located in hilly areas, transportation of goods remained one of the key struggles in the process","11275":"With the help of around 500 volunteers, these three organisations transported meals to many cities, including Swabi, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Buner, Malakand, upper and lower Dir, Dera Ismail Khan, Astore and Gilgit, and 10 districts of AJK, including Bagh, Bhimber, Hattian, Haveli, Kotli, Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Poonch and Sudhnoti","11276":"All three are daily wagers expected to feed households of up to 12 members, all by themselves","11277":"For Nadeem, Muhammad and Siffat, the pandemic came as an additional burden on the already distressed financial conditions of their household","11278":"They ran out of jobs, faced restricted outdoor movement, and worried about the future of their families and the many mouths they have to feed","11279":"What's worse","11280":"There was no end in sight","11281":"Siffat, who is a painter by profession, says, \"Due to coronavirus, I have to stay home and have nothing to do","11282":"I feel very helpless","11283":"\"  Living in Pothi, Rawalkot, Saima Shafi is a widow who has seen plenty of peaks and valleys in life; she cares for her three children, out of which one is disabled, and has taken up the role of General Secretary for a woman-led local support organisation (LSO) in Rawalkot","11284":"Saima feels she has grown immense empathy towards the many marginalised and neglected communities she sees around her","11285":"Volunteering for NRSP since 2011, Saima's dedication and hard work, NRSP was able to identify 12 critically poor families who were unable to fight poverty due to the pandemic","11286":"For the rest of the world, Covid-19 brought with itself heaps of a deadly virus that harmed their healthcare systems","11287":"But for the developing world, the biggest challenge that surfaced was hunger and food insecurity","11288":"Leveraging technology, Rizq Foundation joined hands with the Millions of Meals initiative, and registered millions of empty plates on an app and began distributing meals","11289":"While most human welfare work on the outside looks like simple math equations, the process on the inside is much different","11290":"On the very first day of work, Rizq realised there were plenty of obstacles awaiting response; price fluctuations in the market because people across the country were busy panic-buying and hoarding essentials, and the possibility of duplication of assistance in the selected areas as tons of other non-governmental organisations sprouted to lend a hand","11291":"To work this out and ensure transparency, the organisation collaborated with all existing non-governmental organisations in the said areas, and with the help of a specialised app, recorded and shared data, registered all beneficiaries and assigned them QR codes","11292":"This ensured accuracy of delivery, and prevented double-counting and misallocation","11293":"Part of Rizq Foundation's team of 100 volunteers, Fazal Kabli and Usama Zahid worked relentlessly towards the organisation's mission","11294":"With the pandemic happening and all major parts of the country locked down, Fazal and Usama brought infectious energy and a whole lot of passion to work every day","11295":"Leaving behind all personal engagements, including university classes and tough schedules, they worked on the distribution drive every day, ensuring there were no hiccups or delays","11296":"Apart from the NGOs and the volunteers, the \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is also supported whole-heartedly internally by PepsiCo associates","11297":"Many PepsiCo employees donated generously to add more meals for the programme","11298":"To facilitate and grow this drive even more, the PepsiCo Foundation announced a generous \u2018Double Match Program\u2019, which means that for every Rupee donated by a PepsiCo associate, another two Rupees will be donated by the PepsiCo Foundation","11299":"The combined power of the associates and the PepsiCo Foundation has enabled distribution of an additional 330,000 meals across Pakistan","11300":"Pakistan is the land of hopes, aspirations and many triumphs, with which come challenges aplenty","11301":"The \u2018Millions of Meals\u2019 initiative is rooted in PepsiCo's global vision of 'Winning with Purpose', which is the organisation's promise to do all to save the planet and its many communities","11302":"PepsiCo's partnership aims to continue its support for charitable organisations that provide millions of meals to millions of communities, helping them ward off hunger caused by complete and partial economic inactivity in various parts of the country due to the pandemic","11303":"To sustain these efforts, the company has announced an investment of Rs775 million ($5million approximately) for its multifaceted social impact programs in Pakistan for a total of three years","11304":"And the journey has only begun","11305":"The next phases of the campaign are already underway; paving a path to millions more meals and smiles in near future","11306":"This project is produced in paid partnership with PepsiCo Pakistan","11307":"Reported and written by:

affable Woakes is not one to moan publicly about his lot, sometimes to his own detriment","11390":"Yet Woakes has since taken 15 wickets for England at a shade under 16 apiece","11391":"Woakes had, however, averaged a meagre 5","11392":"22 runs with the bat in his six previous Tests","11393":"But, with England in trouble, he hit his highest Test score since an unbeaten century against India at Lord's in 2018","11394":"The astute Warwickshire all-rounder wanted to make sure the second new ball did not become a factor so went on the attack and countered the short ball by making room to hit through the off-side","11395":"Plenty of orthodox cover-drives followed in a fifty that came from just 59 balls","11396":"And when Buttler was out, Woakes finished the job","11397":"\u201cHe's Mr Dependable,\u201d Root said of Woakes","11398":"\u201cHe's someone you can always trust to deliver exactly what you want","11399":"\u201d This match saw Buttler make a case for both why he should be in and out of the England Test side","11400":"Utilising the run-chasing skills that make him such a formidable batsman in one-day cricket, Buttler and fellow World Cup-winner Woakes turned the tide when Pakistan were on the brink of victory","11401":"Yet they would have been chasing considerably fewer runs to win had not wicketkeeper Buttler dropped and then missed a chance to stump Shan Masood when the opener was on 45 in Pakistan's first innings","11402":"Masood went on to make a Test-best 156, with Buttler's keeping in marked contrast to that of impressive Pakistan gloveman Mohammad Rizwan","11403":"To his credit, Buttler didn't let England's victory stop him from confronting the issue","11404":"\u201cI know it's not good enough as an international wicketkeeper,\u201d he said","11405":"\u201cIf I am going to continue to be a wicketkeeper in this team, I'm going to have to be better","11406":"\u201d When Masood toured England in 2016, he averaged a lowly 17","11407":"75","11408":"But he kept working on his game during more than a year of international exile and the now 30-year-old demonstrated great discipline and shot-making during a near eight-hour 156","11409":"In the process, Masood joined head coach Misbah-ul-Haq as one of just six Pakistan batsmen to have scored a hundred in three consecutive Test innings","11410":"\u201cIt was good application and his hard work has paid off,\u201d said Misbah","11411":"\u201cNow he has proved himself here in England","11412":"\u201c","11413":"MANCHESTER:  England\u2019s most successful bowler James Anderson said on Monday he is not pondering his Test retirement but conceded the decision to step away could be taken out of his hands if he continues to underwhelm","11414":"The 38-year-old has endured a frustrating summer, managing just six wickets in his last three Tests, fuelling speculation that his 17-year Test career could be drawing to a close and has a slew of young and hungry hopefuls biting at his heels for a place in the England team","11415":"\u201cSo, is this the end for the country\u2019s all-time leading wicket-taker","11416":"No, its not,\u201d a bullish Anderson said","11417":"\u201cI want to play as long as I possibly can","11418":"[But] if I keep bowling the way I did, the opportunity to retire will be taken out of my hands","11419":"\u201dGiven his age, speculation about upcoming retirement is something that Anderson will have to get used to","11420":"And it has come under sharper focus following England\u2019s three-wicket win over Pakistan in the first Test of their series on Saturday","11421":"Anderson said he lost his rhythm and let emotions get the better of him for probably the first time in 10 years while posting figures of 1-63 and 0-34 in a frustrating match for him at Old Trafford","11422":"\u201cIt reminded me of when I first started playing, he said, when you get frustrated and a little bit angry, you try to start bowling quicker and that obviously doesn\u2019t help,\u201d he remarked","11423":"There was even a rare no-ball for Anderson, who is fourth on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers with 590 with only retired spin trio of Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble ahead of him","11424":"He knew there would be whispers as he described it about his future at the first sign of any slow-down or regression, especially since England\u2019s fast-bowling department is stocked with more talent than perhaps ever","11425":"\u201cSomething I have done really well throughout my career is deal with pressure that comes with playing, whether that\u2019s the pressure of expectation or the pressure of a match situation,\u201d he said","11426":"\u201cThis week, I felt I didn\u2019t deal with it very well","11427":"That is something I need to look at, go away and work on it and try and make sure if I play in the next game or the Test after that or the winter, whenever I play next, I am ready to cope with that,\u201d Anderson stressed","11428":"\u201cThe minute you start thinking about whispers and things like that, it can affect you","11429":"\u201dAnderson was rested for the second Test of the three-match series England won against the West Indies last month, so being dropped for the match starting in Southampton on Thursday would be no real drama or personal crisis","11430":"The fact that the three Tests against Pakistan come back-to-back means it is almost guaranteed he will miss out on one of them","11431":"Anderson said he will chat about his technique with England head coach Chris Silverwood a former pace bowler himself this week and also take some advice from his long-time new-ball partner Stuart Broad","11432":"The pair of Anderson and Broad  have been virtual ever-presents for England for more than a decade and have pushed each other on and off the field","11433":"\u201cI have never counted my chickens, never thought I was definitely playing the next game,\u201d Anderson said","11434":"\u201cI have always worked hard whether I was at the peak of my powers or when I first started","11435":"\u201cHaving the attitude of working hard in practice, keeping improving and then play well in the game itself","11436":"Those are the things I try to do and that doesn\u2019t change in the next week, the next year or the next three years, whatever it might be","11437":"\u201dEngland, however, will be without Ben Stokes for the remainder of the series as the world\u2019s No","11438":"1 all-rounder is returning to New Zealand for family reasons, and Anderson said it was a big blow to the team","11439":"The bowler said it was another sign that cricket was more empathetic to personal issues nowadays compared to previous years, with captain Joe Root having missed the first Test against the West Indies after his wife gave birth to their second child","11440":"\u201cI think it has definitely changed for the better,\u201d Anderson said","11441":"\u201cAs I\u2019ve done this week, we quite often take this game very seriously and it is our job and quite a big deal for some people","11442":"\u201cBut there is nothing more important than family","11443":"I think it is something that certainly Joe [Root] and Chris [Silverwood] have brought in under their leadership family comes first","11444":"\u201cAnd this group of players rally round each other and help if there is anything that needs help","11445":"And Ben is going through that so it is our job to try to rally round and support him the best we can and hope that things turn out OK,\u201d he added","11446":"Published in Dawn, August 11th, 2020","11447":"What is Pakistan's favourite pastime during the lockdown","11448":"Whine and dine","11449":"As one

increased consumption of trout","11608":"However,  private fish farm owners told The Third Pole that locals cannot use the whole stock","11609":"\"For us [the lockdown is] jamming the whole system because due to lack of sale we cannot continue doing business and meet daily expenses,\" Mujahid said","11610":"Ali said his stock of 20,000 fish needs around 200-250 kg of feed a day","11611":"However, he has had to reduce this to 100 kg","11612":"As a result, 250-300 of his fish per day are dying because they are not getting enough food","11613":"The cash flow problems mean that dealers are supplying fish food to farmers on a loan basis, Ali said","11614":"But the dealers are also charging more for the feed","11615":"To make matters worse, as the fish age and gain weight they become more vulnerable to disease","11616":"Overcrowding in the pools also contributes to problems","11617":"Ali said the farmers do not know what will happen to the stock if the situation continues","11618":"He said farmers will not be able to continue to feed their fish by taking out loans","11619":"Unless demand for trout picks up soon, he said the farmers may lose hope of being able to sell their fish and release them into the Swat river","11620":"While farmers have not yet decided to directly cull stock, reducing the amount of feed is effectively a cull, Ali stressed","11621":"He called for cold storage facilities to be set up in Swat and Gilgit-Baltistan","11622":"This would allow farm owners to freeze their stock and sell them at a later date, when demand recovered","11623":"Farms currently have no such storage capacity","11624":"Not native to the country, brown and rainbow trout were introduced to Pakistan by the British in the early 1900s","11625":"\"Due to crystal-clear cold water of the River Swat, the upper terrain of the district, especially Madyan, Kalam, Utror, Gabral, Matiltan and Usush, became a hub for trout fish farming and breeding after government realised its potential and took initiatives which helped in commercial production in 1984,\" said Zaigham Hassan, assistant professor in the University of Peshawar's zoology department","11626":"Being a carnivorous fish, trout is expensive to feed, especially when it is mature","11627":"It also requires specific conditions to survive, thriving only in the temperate and cool parts of the country","11628":"Without technology to keep the product cold and fresh, transporting it to other parts of Pakistan is not an option","11629":"Mohiuddin, of Gilgit-Baltistan's fisheries department, said the regional government was aware of trout farmers' hardships and had arranged to provide feed free of cost, worth PKR 4","11630":"2 million","11631":"He said the department did not have the resources to provide financial assistance, but added that if the situation continues, he will make proposals to the government","11632":"Mohiuddin has also submitted proposals to establish cold storage","11633":"Jaffar Yahya, assistant director of government organisation the Madyan Trout Training Center in Swat, said he had sent some proposals to the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","11634":"As well as requesting that the government establish cold storage facilities, which farmers would pay a monthly rent for, his suggestions include providing feed free of cost for a period of time, or at least at subsidised rates","11635":"Yahya has also proposed arranging micro loans on very soft terms so that farmers can continue to run farms and feed stock","11636":"He urged both local and international non-governmental organisations to help trout farmers and thereby support thousands of people's livelihoods","11637":"Ali, from the Swat Trout Fish Farming Association, said the lockdown will also impact next year's business cycle","11638":"In Swat and Gilgit-Baltistan, public sector farms are responsible for incubating fish eggs and supplying fry (young fish) to the private sector","11639":"The public sector farms thereby promote private sector fish farming and generate public funds","11640":"However, Ali said, the private sector farms now do not have the funds or space to purchase the fry","11641":"\"If we lose the existing stock, it will also affect the earnings of next year because of our inability to purchase new stock,\" he said","11642":"Last year in Gilgit-Baltistan, the fisheries department sold around 1","11643":"3 million fry fish; these are now fully grown but the farmers cannot sell them","11644":"It takes 12-14 months to rear a fry into an adult trout, raising questions about if the stock will be ready for the tourist season next year","11645":"Previously, there were plans to grow the sector in Gilgit-Baltistan, with a number of farms under construction and the total projected to rise to 200","11646":"This could be a blow to plans to expand a previously profitable enterprise for local people","11647":"Yahya, from the Madyan Trout Training Center, said it is difficult to handle hundreds of tonnes of fully grown fish","11648":"He said it seems the only solution is to lift the ban on hotels and restaurants and allow tourists to return while following strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) that prevent the spread of Covid-19","11649":"\"The hotel industry in Swat has suffered an enormous loss of PKR 3","11650":"5 billion during the past three months due to lockdown,\" said Zahid Khan, president of the All Swat Hotels Association","11651":"He said that the hotel industry would follow all SOPs set by the government for doing business if the ban is lifted","11652":"As of July 31, Pakistan had 903 new Covid-19 cases","11653":"On July 15, Prime Minister Imran Khan hinted at the slow reopening of tourism in the country when he launched the Diamer Basha dam project in Gilgit-Baltistan","11654":"\"Tourism is slowly resuming","11655":"It will not be the same as it was before the pandemic hit, but we can start opening it slowly and start developing SOPs for it,\" Khan said","11656":"This article was originally published by The Third Pole and has been reproduced with

this rule","11668":"When Lee walks in on Elle and Noah kissing, he is heartbroken","11669":"Eventually, Lee accepts their relationship, but the film ends on an uncertain note when Noah heads off to college","11670":"Elle Evans is the saving grace of The Kissing Booth 2, which has a storyline so contrived, it might have been better off as a TV showIn this sequel, Elle is struggling with several issues","11671":"She doesn\u2019t know whether to apply to Harvard to be with Noah, or to stick to her plans to go to UC Berkeley with Lee","11672":"Aside from being able to go to school with her best friend, Elle wants to go to Berkeley to maintain tradition \u2014 after all, that\u2019s where Elle\u2019s mother met Lee\u2019s mother, and the two became best friends","11673":"On the other hand, Elle is deeply insecure about her relationship with Noah","11674":"Long-distance relationships are tough as it is, and Noah has always been popular with the opposite sex","11675":"To make matters

that nothing is going on between him and Chloe, but this puts another strain on their relationship","11677":"Meanwhile, a handsome new transfer student named Marco V","11678":"Pe\u00f1a (Taylor Zakhar Perez) is also catching Chole\u2019s attention","11679":"Phew","11680":"This is just the tip of the iceberg","11681":"There are enough plots and subplots in The Kissing Booth 2 to fill several films","11682":"The narrative feels so contrived that you wonder whether this film would have been better served as a TV show on Netflix instead","11683":"Whether you are a teenager or remember what it was like to be one, you can appreciate that there\u2019s an element of truth to the drama in The Kissing Booth 2","11684":"Unfortunately, it lacks nuance, good characterisation, and offers too many

could no longer assign interactive activities or use peer interaction to facilitate student learning","11850":"Every week, I had to push myself to re-envision a particular module, keeping in mind the limitations my students faced","11851":"Google Forms especially became a constant \u2014 perhaps a crutch \u2014 as I tried to build a space where students could reflect upon what they had learnt during class","11852":"Assignments were spaced out and, sometimes, students submitted late, without facing a penalty","11853":"I knew my students were overworked and trying their best and I wanted to

aligned with journalism values, without compromising student safety","11860":"For one of her courses focusing on interviews, she had to convert assignments focusing on long-form journalism into audio assignments; \u201ctiny compromises\u201d had to be made, but Iqbal and her students figured out a way forward","11861":"On the other hand, Sadaf*, an instructor at a private university in Karachi, struggled with transitioning online","11862":"For one, her department initially did not issue any clear guidelines on what platform to use for online teaching or how to take attendance","11863":"In the absence of support from her university, she sought out professional development opportunities on her own, so that she could better adapt to online teaching","11864":"While her line manager was supportive, Sadaf believes that, ultimately, the management should have involved both students and faculty in how to best transition to online teaching","11865":"The haphazard transition has been stressful and both faculty and students are \u201cultimately losing out\u201d","11866":"Sadaf also shares another alarming fact: she has not been compensated since the spring semester began in February","11867":"This is an additional source of worry for her and she is considering other part time opportunities to supplement her income","11868":"Sadaf requests anonymity and that her employer\u2019s name not be disclosed, to avoid ruffling any feathers","11869":"While his peers struggled with the shift to online, Basharat, a Media Studies student at Szabist, enjoyed an unexpected benefit from the transition","11870":"The student lives in Karachi\u2019s Korangi area, and getting to campus would take him a good 40 minutes","11871":"Now he can simply submit his assignments online and save on commuting","11872":"This is particularly significant given that Basharat is on financial aid and has a stringent budget to spend on university expenses","11873":"Students acknowledge certain other benefits too","11874":"Most acknowledge their instructors for being lenient on deadlines","11875":"Asad, a student at Habib University, cites one particular professor who was a stickler for deadlines but, after Covid-19, even she has been more accommodating","11876":"She would use the first few minutes of class to gauge the energy levels of students and alter her approach accordingly","11877":"Similarly, their supervisor told them that this is the time to \u201cslow down and minimise\u201d","11878":"But despite these efforts, all of the students I spoke to also reported an increased workload","11879":"New assignments and quizzes were being assigned every week and many felt exhausted trying to keep up with the pace","11880":"Instead of cutting down on course content, some instructors seemed to be proceeding at an accelerated pace","11881":"Often the content was exclusively theoretical: the nature of online teaching and the lockdown outside left little or no scope for students to carry out practical work, a vital part of coursework for many students","11882":"For some disciplines, this has meant that students can no longer access the on-campus facilities that are vital to their studies","11883":"New assignments and quizzes were being assigned \n  every week and many felt exhausted trying to keep \n  up with the pace","11884":"Instead of

her clinical modules were initially suspended and, instead, instructors sped through the theory classes","11887":"A module typically takes eight weeks to complete, but the timeline was now compressed","11888":"Under normal circumstances, Hamna would have been wrapping up her second module instead of her fourth one","11889":"For medical students, the clinical visits are vital in helping them understand the practice of medicine","11890":"Hamna recounts how, in her gynaecology module, the instructor had difficulty showing the position of the baby during labour using a model pelvis and a baby mannequin","11891":"In class, the instructor would have laid out the mannequin on the table and demonstrated the position of the baby\u2019s head at different stages of labour","11892":"But, on Zoom, she struggled holding both the mannequins and ensuring it was visible on-screen","11893":"Eventually, she gave up and told her students that they\u2019d see it properly once clinical visits resumed","11894":"Currently, Hamna\u2019s clinical visits have resumed virtually","11895":"Instead of small groups of 13-15, the whole batch of 350 students watches as their instructor details the symptoms of the patient and explains the management online","11896":"But this is not like a typical clinical visit","11897":"\u201c[In those visits] we can question freely and make them repeat and ask about any patient whose history we took, that was confusing or contradicting,\u201d she says","11898":"It is harder to achieve this clarity online and both the instructors and students are getting frustrated","11899":"For Samira*, a final year student at a private arts school, the closure of campus meant she could no longer work in the university studio or have access to the materials and facilities that she needs to complete coursework","11900":"Additionally, Samira is required to prepare for her dissertation and thesis in her seventh semester but her productivity and pace have been affected by the pandemic","11901":"The idea of being graded for work that she is struggling to do during the lockdown, is further demotivating","11902":"For her, the increased workload was merely the university\u2019s way of keeping students busy and to avoid repeating the semester","11903":"Others point out the cancellation of exams as a probable cause","11904":"Given that on-campus exams are no longer an option, many instructors have turned to assigning additional work, most often assignments or quizzes","11905":"An increased workload would be difficult to bear in normal times, given the heat and Ramazan but, during a pandemic, it adds to the financial and mental strain on students","11906":"Moreover, during the lockdown, many families were not calling in their domestic staff","11907":"This meant that the burden of housework has fallen primarily on the female students","11908":"These students had to juggle housework and assignments along with the stress and uncertainty they may already be facing because of Covid-19","11909":"Zunaira\u2019s* case is an apt example","11910":"She is a fourth-semester student and studying on a scholarship","11911":"She does not have access to the internet at her home and nor does she own a laptop","11912":"To complete her assignments, she visits a friend\u2019s house and uses their laptop","11913":"To be able to attend online classes, she uses data packages on her phone","11914":"This is a significant financial investment, especially during a time when Zunaira\u2019s father, a daily wage labourer, has not been able to find employment since the lockdown started","11915":"Zunaira has to juggle her worries about her family\u2019s financial stability while coping with the increased demands of her coursework","11916":"Given the disruptions this semester has witnessed, universities are now also considering the Pass\/Fail grading policy","11917":"LUMS and IBA both have implemented it, with the latter opting for a Pass\/Fail policy across the board rather than as an adaptive grading option","11918":"Moreover, during the lockdown, many families were not \n  calling in their domestic staff","11919":"This meant that the burden \n  of housework has fallen primarily on the female students","11920":"These students had to juggle housework and assignments \n  along with the stress and uncertainty they may already be \n  facing because of Covid-19","11921":"But for Shazia*, a social sciences student at IBA, the Pass-Fail policy came too late","11922":"Initially, Shazia opposed the policy because she had been working very hard for the past two months to keep up with her assignments and classes","11923":"However, she later acknowledges that the policy was a way of bringing grade equity, especially to those students who were not as privileged as herself","11924":"Yet, had the grading policy been instituted when teaching was shifted online instead of at the end of the semester, it would have ensured that students and faculty were working systematically towards a very specific and clear end-goal","11925":"In a pandemic, when uncertainty reigns unchecked \u2014 having a clear grading policy reflects an institution\u2019s clear stance in extending support to students and serves as an equalising force","11926":"For Shazia, the pandemic only highlighted the inherent flaws in our educational system","11927":"\u201cWhy does compassion matter only during a pandemic","11928":"\u201d she says, stressing that it took a pandemic for universities to emphasise that your grades shouldn\u2019t define you","11929":"It isn\u2019t just about internet access or a change in teaching styles and assessment","11930":"The online transition has entailed sacrificing the small rituals that often have the greatest impact on building a rapport with students","11931":"Subhan\u2019s students would often walk back with him to his office, using the time to discuss their concerns or questions","11932":"This was no longer possible once online teaching began","11933":"The loss of this \u201cextra communication\u201d made it difficult for Subhan to check in with his students","11934":"Students also reported how they were more hesitant to ask questions in online classes","11935":"The majority of class would have their cameras switched off as video would cause lags in streaming","11936":"Unmuting their mic and asking the question was not the same as raising your hand in class and getting a response","11937":"Sometimes internet disconnections would mean that students would miss on parts of the lecture as well","11938":"For many students, the closure of campuses meant losing a space which provided them respite from their homes and a chance to find their preferred haunts or sanctuaries","11939":"There is no longer a distinction between the classroom and one\u2019s home","11940":"This can significantly impact how students engage with course content","11941":"Not all courses are politically neutral; liberal arts courses often call for students to critically analyse the society they inhabit","11942":"Discussion is as critical to the course as the content itself","11943":"The campus provides students with a level of anonymity as they debate and discuss these questions","11944":"As Sheema shares, it is somewhat easier to create a safe space within the classroom, where students can share and open up","11945":"At home, they may not have privacy or feel uncomfortable sharing their experiences","11946":"Asad experienced this first-hand","11947":"On campus, Asad felt more comfortable sharing and participating","11948":"The classroom setting accords them a certain level of anonymity, making it easier for them to contribute","11949":"The discourse in some classes calls for vulnerability and it is harder for Asad to be vulnerable at home, where there is a sense of threat","11950":"In one of Asad\u2019s courses, their professor was talking about Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)","11951":"Asad did not feel comfortable contributing and they tried expressing their discomfort to their professor, but the professor didn\u2019t seem to understand the nuances of the situation","11952":"Asad quips, \u201cClass tau khatam ho jayegi [The class will end] but I still have to live here","11953":"\u201dYumna*, a computer sciences student, recently gave an exam on Zoom","11954":"During the exam, students were required to turn their cameras on and remain in the frame for the duration of the examination","11955":"This brings up two core issues: reimagining assessment and reflecting on what we think about our students","11956":"And what methodologies can we use besides exams (questions or essays) to assess our students\u2019 learning","11957":"The practice of recreating an exam on Zoom goes deeper: it signifies a lack of trust in the students themselves","11958":"Across my professional experience, whether it be secondary or tertiary level, I have seen many teachers express their suspicion and mistrust of students again and again","11959":"These sentiments have only heightened during the pandemic; I saw and heard about many instructors assigning additional coursework","11960":"Plenty were operating under the assumption that students were sitting idle at home","11961":"Evidence of students\u2019 domestic responsibilities, mental health concerns and toxic family environments, all failed to sway them","11962":"Reimagining what assessment looks like calls for not only changing the way we transmit information but for treating our students like the adults we sometimes berate them for not being","11963":"Incidents, where students exploit the system or practices of academic dishonesty, are inevitable, but our monitoring mechanisms for students should go beyond barely disguised surveillance and treat them as key stakeholders in this process","11964":"I also acknowledge the labour that goes into crafting and checking non-traditional assessments and the fact that many visiting faculty members are not adequately compensated as it is","11965":"If we are to reimagine assessments, our administrations also need to extend us support, be it financial, or opportunities for professional support","11966":"Talking to multiple students, it also struck me that, despite being in prestigious universities, students often struggle with making their concerns heard","11967":"Additionally, students on financial aid\/scholarships have not been accommodated by most universities","11968":"The exception seems to be LUMS, where students from the National Outreach Program (NOP) have been sent internet devices by the administration","11969":"Consequently, groups like PRSF demand that online classes should only begin when there is digital equity for at least 90 percent of the student population","11970":"Another central demand is that students should be reimbursed their tuition fees","11971":"Tuitions fees are charged on the assumption that students have access to the facilities provided by their respective university","11972":"They argue that, in the light of closure, it is illogical to continue charging students for facilities they can no longer avail","11973":"PRSF\u2019s Alam acknowledges that universities have costs and salaries to pay but he believes that, at the very least, students should be reimbursed 20 percent of the fees","11974":"A look at the Higher Education Commission\u2019s (HEC) Twitter page shows a thread dated April 23, 2020, where HEC outlines policies and commitments to ensuring online learning","11975":"However, apart from mentioning talks with telecommunication companies to introduce subsidised internet packages for students, there is no other policy for ensuring digital equity amongst students","11976":"It seems that the onus is still on students to show up to online classes, no matter where they live or what socio-economic background they come from","11977":"Another core concern that has emerged during this pandemic is the urgent need for student representation and a way for students to organise collectively","11978":"Both Samira and Shazia are actively involved in student politics and organising, the former being a member of PRSF","11979":"PRSF is one of the few organisations working towards empowering students and has been actively working remotely with students","11980":"They have aided them in writing letters to the management and organising sessions","11981":"Samira asserts that her university had not seen students as stakeholders to engage with and instead, without gathering student feedback, they\u2019d moved on to begin online classes","11982":"Shazia shares how she was often at the forefront of negotiating with professors about extending the deadlines or adjusting the workload","11983":"Shazia acknowledges that she would not have been able to do this without the support extended to her by her department head and that isn\u2019t something students in other departments could rely on","11984":"The past two months have been very mentally draining for the student","11985":"\u201cParrhai ke ilawa sirf phadday kiay [Apart from studying, the only other thing I did was arguing],\u201d she says","11986":"Where do we go from here","11987":"As Covid-19 cases rise across the nation, it seems unlikelier day by day that the pandemic will cease any time soon","11988":"An online fall semester seems imminent","11989":"But the virtual classroom can only succeed if students, faculty and management are equally involved in conversations about it","11990":"Much of what are standard practices in university classrooms need to be interrogated and re-envisioned if necessary","11991":"Students like Shazia should not have to bear the additional burden of negotiating for empathy","11992":"What accountability mechanisms can be introduced for faculty, that do not compromise on their agency and privacy but also protect students","11993":"What support can the administration extend to faculty and how should their labour be compensated","11994":"Unlike the spring semester, there is time to start reflecting and looking for answers","11995":"What remains to be seen is whether these conversations translate into substantive policy","11996":"*Name has been changed

explosion in Beirut I've listened repeatedly to the song Ya Beirut (Oh Beirut) by the Lebanese diva Majida al-Roumi, while obsessively reading the news and checking on extended family members \u2014 like any other expatriate Lebanese","12084":"The song, which was originally a poem by the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani, describes the city as it emerged from the civil war","12085":"The poet\/singer apologises to the city for misunderstanding it, for maltreating it and calls on Beirut to \"rise from beneath the rubble\"","12086":"Yet the line that struck me the most, that echoed within me was \"we now know that your roots are deep within us\"","12087":"That was an epiphany, as I always thought I hated Beirut","12088":"I first came to know Beirut in the fall of 1988 as a student at the American University of Beirut (AUB)","12089":"I had not turned 18 yet and came to study English literature as books had been my only friends growing up","12090":"They offered me an escape from the realities of the civil war","12091":"Jane Austen, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and others gave me a window into other worlds when bombs fell and bullets sang around us","12092":"I was excited to start a new life in a city where I could reinvent myself","12093":"Beirut destroyed all my dreams","12094":"Soon after the end of my first semester at AUB in 1989, Michel Aoun, the current president of Lebanon, then head of a military government, began his \"war of liberation\" against Syria","12095":"The western side of Beirut where the university is located was shelled and we were forced to evacuate","12096":"Upon our return following the Ta\u2019if agreement which ended the civil war and sent Aoun into exile in Paris, we resumed our studies","12097":"The spring semester of 1990 was crammed into the next academic year, and we undertook an intensive course of study to graduate on time","12098":"I came to hate with passion every moment I spent on the AUB campus and could not wait to leave Beirut, a city I had come to revile after all the years of turmoil","12099":"My acceptance for an MA in English literature at the University of London was the initial step in a long trajectory that took me to Paris, Berlin, the US and now Sweden","12100":"Over the following decades, I switched from studying literature to Middle Eastern politics","12101":"After growing up in Lebanon during the civil war, I needed to tease apart in an intellectual and systematic manner the events that I sleepwalked through using literature as a crutch","12102":"The resulting book Pax Syriana allowed me to clarify (if only in my own mind) the role of political elites not only in the war, but also in the postwar era","12103":"These political elites were mainly warlords who \"recycled themselves\" as politicians","12104":"They were rich tycoons who had made their money abroad, military men and members of the militant group Hezbollah","12105":"Lebanon, and specifically Beirut, was a virgin territory where these people could enrich themselves and their cronies","12106":"Clientelism has always been a characteristic of Lebanese politics but it evolved into grand corruption in the postwar period","12107":"Graft was rampant in key sectors of the economy, including transport, healthcare, energy, natural resources, construction, waste management and social assistance programmes","12108":"The Lebanese rose up in October 2019 against this political malfeasance, demanding the fall of the sectarian regime","12109":"They called for the removal of Michael Aoun, who had returned to Lebanon in 2005 after his exile in France and became president in 2016","12110":"The coronavirus pandemic put a stop to the marches and sit-ins on the streets of Beirut and other Lebanese cities","12111":"Soon thereafter, the economic freefall predicted by analysts took place","12112":"The economy decimated, Lebanon was falling apart at the seams","12113":"Then came the August 4 explosion in the Beirut port, and the medical, economic and social catastrophe took on gargantuan proportions","12114":"The dead have not been counted yet, as many are still under the rubble, but over 5,000 are wounded","12115":"More than 300,000 are said to be homeless","12116":"The explosion is said to be due to 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate confiscated in 2013 and improperly stored since then in the port","12117":"The chemical was to be auctioned or somehow disposed of, but that never happened","12118":"Its storage near residential areas was a disaster in waiting","12119":"The Beirut port is a key node in the Lebanese transport sector and the import-dependent economy moves most of its imports through it, including the majority of foodstuffs","12120":"However, as a port employee has noted, \"corruption at the port is a rule\" and while Hezbollah controls it, all Lebanese politicians have interests in this crucial transportation hub","12121":"This therefore appears to be a case of criminal negligence on the part of every single Lebanese politician, but especially all the governments that have been in power since 2013","12122":"While writing these words, I find myself choking with a strange mixture of relief and pain","12123":"The relief is the knowledge that I have escaped Lebanon \u2014 that I saw through the mirage of the postwar period and refused to go back to a failing state","12124":"I feel strangely justified in every single decision I took in the past decades","12125":"But my heart is also bleeding for a city I thought I hated","12126":"I hurt for the youth of Lebanon stuck in a hell without hope of escape","12127":"I read the words that Hamed Sinno, the lead singer of the Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila, posted on his Facebook page and I weep:Beirut I hate you so much for making me leave","12128":"I hate you for\n  everything you\u2019ve taken from me \u2026 I hate you so much for finding a \n  way to punish me when I\u2019m not even

schoolchild will receive the same kind of education, and will thus have the same opportunities in life","12232":"The promise is like a dream come true","12233":"But like many well-intentioned plans, the recently-announced review of education policy seems better as an abstract idea","12234":"A closer review of the published material throws up many issues of concern","12235":"The new SNC has been approved and announced for grades I to V so far, and flaws in the policy are already becoming apparent","12236":"For one, the SNC confirms to us that education policymakers continue to have a skewed belief in what constitutes quality education","12237":"They believe that, even if English language is completely alien to a five-year-old child, he must nevertheless be instructed in English","12238":"They also believe \u2014 contrary to all available evidence \u2014 that a greater dose of religious education will produce more honest and useful citizens of Pakistan","12239":"Critical thinking is central to modern knowledge, while through the SNC, policy planners seem to be promoting influences that are antithetical to critical thinking","12240":"The primary focus is on the sheer quantity of information poured into students\u2019 heads","12241":"The government\u2019s slogan of reform is: an end to educational apartheid, a laudable goal indeed","12242":"But what has been approved and notified is a uniform curriculum, not a system of uniform education","12243":"The latter would also imply equal educational facilities for all \u2014 rich and poor, rural and urban, boys and girls","12244":"Only a uniform education would ensure an end to the educational apartheid","12245":"But the government has not put forward any plan for uniform education yet","12246":"And it is unclear if it ever will","12247":"The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government started its tenure with an Education Policy Framework, highlighting reforms in four priority areas in education","12248":"These were: (1) Putting all the out-of-school children in schools, as required by Article 25 A-of the Constitution; (2) eliminating apartheid in education by introducing a uniform curriculum; (3) enhancing the quality of education; and (4) emphasising technical and vocational education","12249":"The Framework was generally regarded as based on a correct diagnosis of the problems of school education in the country","12250":"If pursued properly and thoughtfully, reforms made within this framework could potentially add quality to public education","12251":"In the two years since the Framework was announced, the government has made some progress in the second priority area by preparing a SNC, but has made no move in the other three priority areas","12252":"I suspect this is because each of the other three priority areas would require a heavy financial commitment, which the meagre national allocation to education could not promise","12253":"On the other hand, introducing a new curriculum comes for free","12254":"The government\u2019s slogan of reform is: an end to educational apartheid, \n  a laudable goal indeed","12255":"But what has been approved and notified is a \n  uniform curriculum, not a system of uniform education","12256":"The latter would \n  also imply equal educational facilities for all \u2014 rich and poor, rural \n  and urban, boys and girls","12257":"Take priority number one","12258":"With 22","12259":"8 million out of school children, according to Unicef data, and the total number of enrolled school students around 25 million, there are nearly as many out of school children as there are in school","12260":"To put nearly 23 million additional children into school would be a gigantic task","12261":"Pakistan would need to build nearly as many schools as exist today, furnish them and employ as many new teachers as are currently in service","12262":"Imagine the amount of resources needed to provide schooling to all 23 million out of school children","12263":"How difficult this will be is illustrated by the example below","12264":"The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) lies right under the nose of the federal government and is hardly some rural district of Balochistan or Sindh, and yet there is a 35 percent deficit of teachers in ICT public schools","12265":"The posts are not being filled because the government has no money to pay the additional salaries","12266":"Some federal government model schools are running at two-thirds of the approved strength of teachers","12267":"Teachers are either forced to conduct multi-grade teaching or to ask a senior student to stand in the class with a cane in hand, to keep the children quiet","12268":"Let us consider the third priority area: the enhancement of quality of education in school","12269":"That the quality of learning in public and private, urban and rural, schools is extremely worrisome has been regularly highlighted by Annual Status of Education Report ASER) surveys for over a decade","12270":"These are considered reliable to the point that even the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training (MOFEPT) refers to their data rather than that from the official National Educational Management Information System","12271":"If the government is really serious about the quality of education, it must not pass the burden of providing education to the private sector","12272":"A large part of the private education sector consists of low fee schools","12273":"Their business model works with low fees only because they employ uncertified teachers at very low salaries","12274":"Hence the quality of instruction in those schools remains abysmally poor","12275":"The government knows this very well, because it supports such schools through national and provincial Education Foundations, and pays them a meagre subsidy of 300 rupees per student to encourage them to continue","12276":"Enhancing the quality of instruction in public schools would require several things","12277":"One, it would require more frequent and better pre-service and in-service training for the teachers","12278":"Provincial staff development departments would vouch that, presently, a public sector teacher receives only about three days of in-service training per year","12279":"What is needed is perhaps 10 times more training","12280":"Two, public schools still lack in essential facilities such as furniture, water supply, toilets, etc","12281":"The situation continues to be so in spite of receiving donations for the infrastructural improvement of schools from several countries","12282":"A rigorous auditing of where these funds go is badly needed","12283":"Three, textbooks provided by the state are of abysmal quality, both in content as well as in presentation","12284":"Pakistani textbook boards have repeatedly proved unable to provide good-quality learning material","12285":"A comparison between the books used in public schools with those used in the elite private schools easily shows the differential in quality","12286":"A heavy investment in high-quality textbooks is an essential requirement for improving educational quality","12287":"There is no reason to restrict the choice to local authors and printers","12288":"For the sake of investment in our national future, we should keep open the option of buying the best teaching material, even if local cultural sensitivities call for some editing","12289":"And four, public examinations of today only require reproduction of text","12290":"Unless the assessment system is radically altered, the quality of education in the public schooling system cannot improve","12291":"Those who set high-quality examinations do not come cheap","12292":"From the above, it is obvious that improving the quality of education cannot be achieved without a heavy financial input","12293":"Finally, the last priority area of the Educational Framework \u2014 introducing technical and vocational training in schools \u2014 would also require substantial expenditure on equipping schools with functioning workshops and an assured supply of consumables","12294":"Thus, meaningful action in priority areas numbers 1, 3 and 4 obviously call for substantial financial input","12295":"Instead, the government has taken the easy road by simply tinkering with the curriculum","12296":"This not only vitiates the very idea of reform, it also creates other deep problems","12297":"Let us now come to the SNC","12298":"In the current design of SNC, the federal government has transgressed upon the constitutional domain of the provinces","12299":"The Parliament, through the 18th constitutional amendment, had transferred the curriculum-making authority to provinces, restricting the federal government\u2019s domain to the federal capital area and the educational institutions directly under its control","12300":"This did not go down well with those who (wrongly) regard provincial autonomy a danger to national cohesion","12301":"It also did not go down well with those who regard school education less as an exercise in enabling future generations to face global challenges, and more as a means to influence young minds ideologically","12302":"To put nearly 23 million additional children into school would be a \n  gigantic task","12303":"Pakistan would need to build nearly as many schools \n  as exist today, furnish them and employ as many new teachers as \n  are currently in service","12304":"Imagine the amount of resources needed to \n  provide schooling to all the 23 million out-of-school children","12305":"A grievous yet inevitable consequence of this effective re-centralisation of the curriculum is immediately apparent in the social studies curriculum","12306":"In a decentralised curriculum, a child is taken gradually from an awareness of self, to family, to neighbourhood, then to awareness about his or her district, about the province, then nation and then the world","12307":"In this re-centralised curriculum, in contrast, however, the child is taken from the awareness of self, to family, to the neighbourhood and then straight to the nation","12308":"A child under this leapfrog curriculum will never get to learn about his or her district or province, which will be a serious loss to the child\u2019s worldview","12309":"The leapfrog seems to be a deliberate policy of those whose narrow view of nationalism insists on denying identities of constituent nationalities","12310":"SNC_Social Studies curriculum by EOS Dawn on ScribdThe new curriculum documents carry a slogan of \u201cOne Nation One Curriculum\u201d, implying that, without a single curriculum, we cannot remain one nation","12311":"This is false","12312":"There are countless examples of countries having diverse curricula \u2014 even ones that vary from school to school \u2014 and yet a strong sense of common nationhood","12313":"Advocates of uniformity may like to keep in mind a well-known saying: uniformity has the colour of deserts while the beauty of gardens is in their diversity","12314":"While rifts and dissension do exist within Pakistan, their causes lie well outside the school curriculum","12315":"Oversimplification may create further chasms between the different peoples of Pakistan instead of moving us towards greater unity","12316":"The educational apartheid is said to be the reason behind the need for a uniform curriculum","12317":"As is well known, the Pakistani education system is split along three broad lines: a tiny sliver of expensive private schools preparing students for foreign examinations; low-to-middle end public\/private schools that follow the federal\/provincial curriculum; and madressah education, that aims to produce the clergy","12318":"The prime minister has been very passionately arguing against this apartheid, pointing out differentials in the competencies developed in each and hence the corresponding opportunities that open up before students graduating from each of the three systems","12319":"He emphasises that the students from elite schools have the best opportunities and graduates of madressahs have relatively much fewer","12320":"This is a valid point","12321":"Mainstreaming of madressahs has been a desire of many a government in the past, and even of religious groups and political parties","12322":"In the 1980s and 1990s, the Institute of Policy Studies, Islamabad, a think tank of the Jamaat-i-Islami, held conferences of all the madressah systems to explore if, besides the theological subjects, they would open themselves to teaching of contemporary disciplines","12323":"One stubborn response was that the reason of existence of madressahs was to not let the Islamic theological disciplines, which debate intricacies of belief and practices, be forgotten, and that madressahs exist to produce clergy to keep the knowledge of Islam alive","12324":"But in the post-9\/11 environment, when all eyes were focused on them, most madressahs were persuaded by the Musharraf government to introduce contemporary subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Computer Literacy, etc in their list of courses","12325":"So, while Prime Minister Imran Khan is right that the graduates of madressahs remain on the lowest rung of job opportunities, he seems unaware of the fact that most madressahs had already included contemporary subjects in their curricula","12326":"This can be checked from the websites of all the madressahs\u2019 wafaqs (boards)","12327":"SNC_General Science

system","12329":"Although the public school curriculum, which is followed by all the public schools as well as a number of private schools, gets reviewed every few years, it does not seem to have any significant effect on the quality of learning","12330":"Year after year, surveys on students\u2019 competencies bring out the terribly worrying levels of abilities in students","12331":"For example, the 2019 national survey of public and low-fee private schools by ASER shows that 15 percent of grade V students still cannot read Urdu sentences, 11 percent cannot read English sentences and eight percent cannot do simple two-digit subtractions","12332":"These are all recorded in the annual ASER reports","12333":"Universities lament the poor quality of their new admissions, and employers are unhappy about the quality of graduates they receive from universities","12334":"There is, thus, a genuine concern about the quality of education and to put the finger on the right causes is the foremost challenge for Pakistani education policy planners","12335":"Given these problems and the desire of the government to evolve a system that provides a level playing field for the graduates of different kinds of educational institutions, there were expectations that this levelling exercise would be coupled with quality enhancement schemes","12336":"That is the only way to create a level playing field","12337":"For such an objective, the choice should have been the best available standard in the country","12338":"As the prime minister himself admits, the best quality comes out of the English-medium private schools, which follow some foreign educational schemes, either the British O and A levels or the International Baccalaureate","12339":"It was expected that the new curriculum would be modelled after these schools","12340":"But this was not to be","12341":"Instead, the government chose the public school curriculum devised in 2006","12342":"The benchmarks, the learning outcomes and the identification of competencies for each level remain roughly the same as in the 2006 curriculum","12343":"There is, therefore, no reason for optimism because the quality of learning with this curriculum would be just as unsatisfactory as in today\u2019s public schools","12344":"With the same course content as before, the standard of textbooks and classroom teaching is likely to remain the same","12345":"In short, the best of the three standards has not been adopted","12346":"In addition, there is no indication at all of any serious effort to move the examination system away from rote learning","12347":"All of this means that, if the new curriculum is imposed on the elite private schools, their educational standard will face a substantial degradation","12348":"The courses on English, Urdu, Arithmetic, Science and Social Studies are hardly distinguishable from those prescribed in the 2006 National Curriculum \u2014 they have the same benchmarks and the same learning outcomes as before","12349":"But one area where major changes have been introduced is in the Islamiat curriculum","12350":"The National Curriculum 2006 for grades I and II had topics of Islamiat included in a course named General Knowledge, and was consequently a source of deep discomfort among non-Muslim children, since they were forced to learn Islamiat","12351":"The SNC has taken these topics out from General Knowledge and made a separate full course on Islamiat","12352":"As per the declared curricula for grades I to V, the new course on Islamiat is far heavier in content than any previous Pakistani school curriculum for this subject","12353":"When compared against Islamiat taught in madressahs at this level, it turns out that public and private schools will be teaching more religion than even the madressahs","12354":"SNC - Islamiat curriculum by EOS Dawn on ScribdFrom the published SNC document, that also details the structure of topics that will be followed up to grade XII, the Islamiat course for all the grades from I to XII will be structured around the following seven topics:Holy Quran and Hadith\nFaith and supplications\nThe life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\nIslamic mannerism\nPublic dealings and social behaviour\nIslamic personalities and guiding lights\nIslamic teachings and contemporary issues  As an example, the Islamiat course for grade III in SNC has the following detail:SNC Islamiat Curriculum for Grade IIIFor grade III, the SNC prescribes the following topics:\u2022 Nazra Quran from paarah three to eight\n\u2022 Memorisation: Surahs Fateha, Kausar, Nasr, Ikhlaas\n\u2022 Memorisation with translation: Allahu Akbar, Astaghfirallah, Jazakallaho Khaira, Durood-i-Ibrahimi\n\u2022 Memorise: eight prescribed ahadith\n\u2022 Memorise: prayers to start a meal and to end a meal\n\u2022 Introduce Tawheed, translate Kalma-i-Tayyaba and Surah Ikhlas\n\u2022 Learn about nabuwwat and risalat\n\u2022 Memorise Kalma-i-Shahadat with translation\n\u2022 Learn about azaan, namaz and wuzu, and qibla and masjid\n\u2022 Topics from the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH)\n\u2022 Ikhlaq-o-Adaab from the Quran and Sunnah\n\u2022 Huquq-ul-Ibad from the Quran and Sunnah\n\u2022 Lessons on Hazrat Adam (AS), Hazrat Nooh (AS) and Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (RA)\n\u2022 Lessons on health from the Quran and Sunnah  It is instructive to compare the above with the madressah curriculum for the same grade","12355":"The information in this case has been taken from the websites of various madressah boards","12356":"Only two of them, Tanzeem-ul-Madaris of Jamaat Ahle Sunnat and Rabitatul Madaris of Jamaat-i-Islami provide the curriculum for primary classes","12357":"Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Islamiat Curriculum for Grade IIINazra of the

Sunnah\nTowheed wa Risalat\nAakhirat\nIslamic governance  It is clear that the Islamiat curriculum in SNC is much heavier than in madressahs","12358":"It requires a large amount of memorisation in Arabic and, in places, in Urdu translation as well","12359":"It requires memorisation of ahadith in Arabic and in Urdu","12360":"The two madressah boards\u2019 curricula do not require memorisation, or even reading, of ahadith","12361":"Memorisation of Hadith was not a part of even the 2006 curriculum","12362":"The 2006 Curriculum required learning ahadith only in grades IX and X, and only in Urdu","12363":"In the SNC, on the other hand, primary grade students are required to memorise Arabic and Urdu versions of 45 ahadith by grade V, with the following grade-wise distribution: 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 15","12364":"It can only lead us to conclude that the framers of the SNC have been overly zealous in prescribing Islamiat content","12365":"If the teaching of Islamiat is so extensive at the primary level, where young children are still struggling with elementary literacy, one is left wondering how much more extensive it will get at the higher levels","12366":"Punjab has already issued an ordinance to teach Quranic studies at the highest levels of studies in universities","12367":"How will those studies be different from madressah curricula","12368":"It is not beyond the pale of possibility that the higher level Islamiat courses will be inspired by madressah curricula","12369":"In this sense, SNC looks like a \u2018madressah-isation\u2019 of schools","12370":"After Nazra Quran, the next step in madressahs is learning the Quran with translation, and then, at a higher level, looking deeper into interpretations of the Holy Book, the tafseer, the taabeer and then fiqh","12371":"It is well known that sects in Islam have grown out of such interpretations by the most learned scholars","12372":"We also know that different sects of Islam are followers of different interpretations","12373":"Different schools follow different makatib-e-fikr or schools of thought, and their differences have persisted over the centuries","12374":"When elevated to the level of colleges and universities, will the study of Islamiat not touch upon these divisive issues and lead to sectarian tensions on campuses","12375":"Now let\u2019s come to Article 22(1) of the Constitution, which is a part of the chapter on fundamental rights","12376":"It is meant to safeguard a particular right of religious minorities in Pakistan","12377":"It says: \u201cNo person attending any educational institution shall be required to receive religious instruction, or take part in any religious ceremony, or attend religious worship, if such instruction, ceremony of worship relates to a religion other than his own","12378":"\u201dThis law implies that no lesson in any textbook that is compulsory to students of all faiths can contain material specific to any religion","12379":"The SNC violates this fundamental right of non-Muslim Pakistani citizens by prescribing lessons in Urdu and English courses that are already a part of the Islamiat curriculum","12380":"Urdu textbooks are asked to start with a hamd and a naat, and there is invariably a lesson on Seerat-un-Nabi or the life of the Prophet (PBUH)","12381":"A lesson on Seerat-un-Nabi is also prescribed in English textbooks of all grades","12382":"This is in spite of the fact that the course on Islamiat has a substantial part on the Seerat","12383":"It also has another substantial part on sacred personalities of early Islam","12384":"When challenged to justify this violation of constitutional right, officials at MOFEPT refuse to correct the wrong","12385":"Instead they prescribe outlandish ways of avoiding the violation: they want teachers to ask non-Muslim students to leave the class during such lessons (and do what, they do not say)","12386":"They also prescribe exempting non-Muslim students from answering examination questions relating to such lessons, a risk that few students would want to take since examiners could easily be prejudiced against non-Muslims","12387":"They keep insisting on retaining Islamiat lessons in compulsory courses in spite of the fact that these topics are already covered in the exclusive course on Islamiat","12388":"It seems even the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens are not there to be respected","12389":"Similarly, the Urdu and English curricula suggest lesson topics such as honesty, truthfulness, etc","12390":", on which textbook writers in the past have written lessons based on sacred Islamic personalities \u2014 stories that are also a part of Islamiat","12391":"Requiring non-Muslim students to read those lessons also violates Article 22(1)","12392":"Textbook writers must, therefore, receive unambiguous instruction that a book on a compulsory course must not contain material belonging to any faith","12393":"According to several statements by government officials, agreements were reached with heads of the madressah systems during the consultations on SNC","12394":"Under one agreement, the madressah students will be required to take board examinations of grades VIII to XII in contemporary subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, etc","12395":", and pass","12396":"The requirement is not a big challenge at all","12397":"As long as board examinations remain what they are now, the exam questions would merely require rote memorisation, in which madressah students are unbeatable","12398":"The SNC also visualises providing massive employment opportunities to madressah graduates, and hence stimulating the creation of more such institutions","12399":"In the primary curriculum, for example, it requires every school to employ one madressah certified qari  to teach nazra in the style that prevails in madressahs","12400":"It is easy to see that, with more of madrassah-style Islamiat coming in the higher classes, each school will be asked to employ a madrassah-certified aalim to teach the extended Islamiat course","12401":"In another agreement, the state has promised to depute three teachers to each madressah to teach contemporary courses such as English, Science, Mathematics and Social Studies","12402":"The salaries of these teachers will be paid out of the public exchequer","12403":"There are serious implications of these steps","12404":"The following are some rough estimates based on data from the Pakistan Economic Survey 2019-20: As per the Pakistan Economic Survey 2019-20, there are about 172,500 registered primary schools in the country, and about 260,000 schools of all kinds","12405":"Employing two madressah-certified teachers in each school amounts to providing jobs to 520,000 madressah-certified persons in public and private schools","12406":"This opens an unprecedented floodgate of jobs for madressah graduates, most of them to be paid out of the public exchequer","12407":"The new curriculum documents carry a slogan of \u201cOne Nation One Curriculum\u201d, \n  implying that, without a single curriculum, we cannot remain one nation","12408":"This is \n  false","12409":"There are countless examples of countries having diverse curricula \u2014 even \n  ones that vary from school to school \u2014 and yet a strong sense of common nationhood","12410":"Advocates of uniformity may like to keep in mind a well-known saying: uniformity \n  has the colour of deserts while the beauty of gardens is in their diversity","12411":"In addition, the school environment will be greatly influenced by these madressah graduate teachers","12412":"There are a total of 1","12413":"72 million school and college teachers in the country","12414":"According to the arrangement worked out in the SNC, with an additional 520,000 inductions, the madressah graduate teachers will immediately form almost a quarter of the entire body of teachers","12415":"They will have an immense influence on not only teaching in schools and colleges, but will also have a substantial political influence on the academic environment \u2014 an influence that has no precedent in the history of South Asia, if not world history","12416":"According to MOFEPT estimates, there are 35,000 registered and unregistered madressahs in the country","12417":"According to the SNC, three teachers on the public payroll will be employed by the government for each madressah, to teach the non-religious subjects","12418":"That means employing around 105,000 additional teachers or using existing school teachers despite the deficit of teachers in public schools","12419":"In short, under the SNC, the madressah system has received a huge boost","12420":"This is all to bring only three million madressah students into the mainstream of education","12421":"In return, madressahs will get paid teachers for contemporary subjects, and a large number of jobs will open up for madressah graduates in public and private schools","12422":"The cost of this mainstreaming is multidimensional, excessive and fraught with unforeseen impacts","12423":"The federal government has extended itself beyond its constitutional domain","12424":"Education in its entirety is a provincial subject and it is the provinces that will be eventually held responsible for the intellectual development of their young generations","12425":"They must not feel bound to an exercise carried out in violation of the constitution, even though they had consented to sit in consultations on SNC","12426":"Illustration by

he apparently told them","12552":"\u201cThey have a plastic bag ready","12553":"\u201d The boy\u2019s parents allegedly rushed to the hospital half an hour later \u201cto receive his dead body","12554":"\u201d The accounts are harrowing and too many","12555":"Nur has seen people\u2019s mistrust regarding the coronavirus grow stronger over time","12556":"She, and thousands of community healthcare providers like her, have been going into their assigned union council neighbourhoods to provide basic healthcare to people since March, when (stricter) coronavirus-led lockdowns were enforced in the country","12557":"\u201cUnless things are properly investigated and communicated to the general public, people will continue to think of the coronavirus as a big drama [orchestrated by those] with ulterior motives and [conspiracy theories about] Bill Gates will keep getting popular,\u201d she says","12558":"Community healthcare providers, including LHWs and polio workers, like Nur are an integral part of Pakistan\u2019s Covid-19 response and are fighting the virus head-on, often without any protective gear or even fair compensation","12559":"Many of them have been part of Pakistan\u2019s polio drives for years and know that the introduction of a vaccine alone will not mean the end of the country\u2019s battle against Covid-19","12560":"Indeed, these men and women understand the ground realities and the general public\u2019s distrust of vaccines in a way few others can","12561":"Specific guidelines were issued by the Sindh government on how fieldwork on contraceptive provision and referrals for women with babies due would continue in the coming months of life under the pandemic","12562":"LHWs, who work as part of the government\u2019s expanded programme on immunisation (EPI), were to continue even when everyone else was being instructed to stay at home","12563":"They were to continue vaccinating children against diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus and measles, via fixed centres and door-to-door service, as LHWs working with EPI have been doing for a quarter of a century now","12564":"Over the years, various other vaccines, including the polio vaccine, have been added in the programme","12565":"Until recently, widespread vaccination campaigns came to a halt to stop the transmission of the new virus, but primary healthcare for women and children continued","12566":"Pregnant women had to be referred for deliveries and infants had to take their timely vaccine shots","12567":"In many parts of Pakistan, people are suspicious of these vaccine shots, and the suspicions have apparently only grown stronger during the pandemic","12568":"As the virus spread, so did this mistrust and WhatsApp voice notes of grieving families swearing that their loved ones were killed by deadly teekas","12569":"This fear is a feature of doubt and it will be present in our collective future for some time, and not just in Pakistan","12570":"The world has had a complicated history with vaccines","12571":"Hostility toward vaccination has existed as long as the vaccines themselves","12572":"Perhaps since the early 1800s, when Edward Jenner, an English physician and scientist and the pioneer of vaccines, experimented to see if children could be protected against smallpox by being infected with lymphs from a person infected with cowpox","12573":"At that time too, the idea was taken as unholy and bizarre, giving rise to tensions between the population and the government, as people felt that their personal liberties were at stake","12574":"The World Health Organisation (WHO) included hesitancy towards vaccines in a list of top 10 threats to global health last year","12575":"But despite opposition \u2014 historical and prevailing \u2014 vaccinations are considered one of the top achievements of the 20th century","12576":"With the Covid-19 pandemic, the vaccine challenge has multiplied, owing to conspiracy theories and general distrust","12577":"In the United States alone, an Associated Press-NORC poll indicated that one in five Americans would refuse a Covid-19 vaccine, whenever the trials are completed and it is ready to be injected","12578":"Pakistanis don\u2019t feel much different","12579":"\u201cI can\u2019t even say that I would like to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in the first place,\u201d says Nur, scoffing at the idea of difficulties she might face if the anti-Covid vaccine is made part of the routine immunisation","12580":"\u201cIt would be very hard to work with this vaccine","12581":"Who would want it when there are so many stories with the coronavirus disease","12582":"\u201dSeven months after the virus first took the world in its grip, Pakistan\u2019s population is seemingly torn between fear of the virus and a denial of its existence","12583":"There is outright refusal to wear masks and to follow standard operating procedures of social distancing","12584":"In these circumstances, fear of the virus is also felt by community healthcare providers when they go for immunisation work in their communities","12585":"And even their routine work is made more difficult because many believe that hospitals are giving Covid-19 patients fatal injections","12586":"\u201cHow am I to trust you with any injection","12587":"Who knows what\u2019s in there","12588":"\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have any food or money and you care about injections","12589":"\u201dCommunity healthcare providers have heard these too often in the past three months","12590":"They know vaccination against Covid-19 is going to be tough","12591":"Over the years, vaccines that have eradicated diseases from the world haven\u2019t had the same success in Pakistan","12592":"A polio surge was reported last year, when 100-plus infections were reported","12593":"And the expensive vaccines package that, so far, has vaccines that deal with 10 diseases, keeps expanding","12594":"Millions of rupees are invested into these and any Covid-19 vaccine would be a new addition","12595":"The good news is that many doctors say that the vaccine is coming","12596":"The government assures that efforts are underway for Pakistan to receive the vaccine when it is ready","12597":"Shipment logistics and the setting up of a scientific team to target high-risk populations \u2014 such as patients with co-morbidities, pregnant women and healthcare workers, including those working in communities \u2014 are among its priorities","12598":"\u201cThe Covid-19 vaccine is not far into the future,\u201d Dr Rafiq Khanani, professor and chairman of pathology and microbiology at the Dow University of Health Sciences and the president of the Infection Control Society Pakistan tells Eos","12599":"\u201cIn the first quarter of 2021, Pakistan would have been past phase two of the vaccine trial","12600":"The work of misconception eradication and positive opinion building towards it needs to start now","12601":"\u201d The WHO lists 25 Covid-19 vaccines in clinical evaluation around the world, while 139 are listed to be in preclinical evaluation","12602":"Pakistan is not working on any vaccine development but, so far, has been invited by a Chinese pharmaceutical company to conduct trials of its inactivated vaccine, and will likely be doing more in the near future as global trials see the light of day","12603":"\u201cPakistan will also conduct trials as the virus has shown mutations in different parts of the world and since the genetic makeup of populations is different around the world, the response is gauged accordingly,\u201d says Dr Khanani","12604":"\u201cIf virus transmission becomes slower in the future and there is a time lapse until a vaccine arrives, it will get tough to conduct trials in the country and for people to become more receptive towards the vaccine,\u201d he adds","12605":"Hesitancy over vaccines is prevalent and may have been increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009, according to studies","12606":"At that time too, there were beliefs that the response to the pandemic had been influenced by commercial interests, planting the seeds of further doubt towards vaccines","12607":"While the general population\u2019s reluctance towards vaccines is driven by concerns of safety and belief in alternative medicine, a UK-based literature review of over a thousand scientific articles cited the same reasons for healthcare professionals too","12608":"It was believed by some that the pandemic-influenza vaccine contained dangerous additives, thought to trigger allergies","12609":"The critical review conducted in the UK cites a lack of knowledge among healthcare workers about national guidelines on vaccinations as one of the reasons behind their reluctance to use the vaccine","12610":"Even those who were aware, didn\u2019t feel confident in advising in favour of the vaccine and had their own doubts about it","12611":"But despite opposition, microbiologists and epidemiologists have crusaded over decades to keep pushing for vaccines, to the extent that they have now become the most cost-effective measure for public health globally","12612":"\u201cThe fact that in the last 100 years humans have experienced a rise in life expectancy of up to 40 years is because of the impact of vaccines,\u201d says Dr Rana Safdar, chief of disease surveillance at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad","12613":"Awareness is clearly key","12614":"\u201cIn Pakistan, people listen to doctors, nurses and paramedical staff and, in rural settings, lady health workers,\u201d says Dr Khanani","12615":"\u201cPeople are not as stupid as some believe them to be ","12616":"","12617":"","12618":"Right awareness has to be spread through the right people","12619":"\u201dIn Pakistan, these right people include community healthcare providers","12620":"Since March, these workers have been working on spreading awareness about Covid-19","12621":"Following the Global Polio Eradication Initiative guidelines, Pakistan was among 39 countries where campaigns came to a halt","12622":"The polio eradication programme realigned the polio workforce \u2014 at all levels from provincial to divisional \u2014 to support the government response to the coronavirus, through communication and community engagement","12623":"Workers designed pamphlets, banners and videos and shared messages through WhatsApp and Facebook groups","12624":"Some of the male workers prepared panaflexes in neighbourhoods, installed loudspeakers on trucks and went around their assigned union councils, calling out the threats of the disease and asking people to stay indoors","12625":"Women polio workers went from home to home with brochures, informing people about the virus, what they needed to do to remain safe, and referring people with symptoms for testing, similar to the duties assigned to LHWs","12626":"They helped in other efforts too","12627":"\u201cI was asked to make a list of households in my union council who had daily wagers and were deserving of ration in the lockdown,\u201d says Sumiya, a polio workers\u2019 supervisor in North Karachi","12628":"\u201cWe visited houses, collected all the data within five days and shared it with them","12629":"Not that any ration was actually provided to the deserving families","12630":"\u201dAnti-polio vaccine opposition may be high in some parts of the country, but many experts are of the belief that infectious disease and microbiologists\u2019 advocacy groups are much better placed to advocate for the use of a Covid-19 vaccine and awareness in communities","12631":"With a little training, community healthcare providers can also be real assets in the coming battle, they believe","12632":"\u201cWhenever there is an issue of infection control in Pakistan, LHWs can play a huge role in surveillance, as they are the primary link for people in the health system,\u201d says Dr Ali Mir, a public health specialist and an associate at the Population Council, Pakistan","12633":"\u201cUnfortunately, they lack training and education, proper equipment supplies of disease surveillance and personal protective equipment, otherwise they could be involved in contact tracing and curbing","12634":"But it\u2019s not too late as yet,\u201d he adds","12635":"Since the outbreak, in addition to their primary healthcare work, community healthcare providers have indeed become part of Covid-19 contact tracing","12636":"The supervisors send in daily reports of people in their communities who have a travel history or are experiencing symptoms","12637":"\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a disease surveillance system as such for Covid-19 so we adapted the one for polio to monitor the risk of spread,\u201d says Dr Safdar, who is also the national coordinator for polio eradication","12638":"As the virus spreads deeper into communities, it hasn\u2019t spared community healthcare providers who have been going into the communities without any protection, despite district health offices being mandated to provide masks, sanitisers and gloves","12639":"Following Eidul Fitr, one day after returning from work in Karachi\u2019s District East, Wajiha* could feel her body aching all over","12640":"Thinking it was just tiredness after a long day at work, she ignored it","12641":"Sometime later, she started feeling feverish and, much to her surprise, couldn\u2019t taste anything she was eating","12642":"A young widow and a mother of two teenagers living with her mother in Chanesar Goth, Wajiha started expecting the worst \u2014 Covid-19 had reached her","12643":"She feared that if she would go to a hospital, doctors would admit her","12644":"What would she do then","12645":"She had no money for all that","12646":"And what if the government got to know and made her quarantine at home","12647":"All the neighbours would know and would blame her for spreading the virus","12648":"No","12649":"This simply could not happen","12650":"Wajiha shared her concerns with her manager, a lady health supervisor","12651":"A few days later, she mustered the courage to go to the Dow University of Health Sciences and got herself tested","12652":"As expected, the result came back positive","12653":"She experienced constant fevers and had difficulty in breathing","12654":"But more than anything else, she was extremely worried for her two children and her mother","12655":"The house she lives in is small and total self-isolation was not an option","12656":"Workers like Wajiha are even ostracised for catching the virus","12657":"\u201cOur clients in the communities yell at us for bringing the virus into their homes,\u201d says a lady supervisor, who manages a team of 15 workers","12658":"She says that workers vaccinate children, interact with pregnant women and move from one home to the other","12659":"\u201cIt is hard to know the exact source from where anybody contracted the virus","12660":"\u201dAny protective gear these workers have, they bought on their own","12661":"In late Ramazan, a few workers in Hyderabad protested this lack of gear and refused to go on duties","12662":"Their colleagues were getting infected and they didn\u2019t feel safe","12663":"\u201cWe were then given tiny bottles [of sanitiser], that some got and many others didn\u2019t,\u201d Mahwash, a supervisor in Hyderabad tells Eos","12664":"\u201cNothing since then","12665":"\u201dDistrict health officers in Karachi stress on the safety of all healthcare workers","12666":"\u201cLady Health Workers are our own, just like doctors and nurses","12667":"They report symptoms to us immediately and we get them tested, as we don\u2019t want to risk any transmission from healthcare workers,\u201d says Dr Shafique Ahmed, the District Health Officer, District West","12668":"But Bushra Bano Arain, chairperson of the All Pakistan Lady Health Workers Association, says that workers are in no position to get treatment if they contract the virus","12669":"\u201cThey are scared,\u201d she says","12670":"\u201cWe are now openly resisting going into the field and asking our communities to seek consultation over phone\/WhatsApp","12671":"But there are emergencies and, in the current times, people need all kinds of medical help","12672":"\u201d While many healthcare professionals in Pakistan acknowledge how essential the services of community healthcare providers are, these essential workers have been struggling for even their basic rights for a decade","12673":"As they fight a pandemic on the one hand, they also continue to fight injustice and demand their rights","12674":"In the first week of July, raised voices could be heard outside the DG Health Sindh Office in Hyderabad","12675":"With their heads covered with colourful dupattas and chadars, and a few wearing masks and others wearing veils, a group of LHWs gathered in the 40C scorching heat of Hyderabad","12676":"\u201cJeena hoga marna hoga, dharna hoga [We will protest, come what may],\u201d they shouted in unison","12677":"They demanded that they be paid and given fuel allowances as promised","12678":"Forty-one LHWs in Hyderabad haven\u2019t been paid in the past 18 months","12679":"Supervisors aren\u2019t getting their petrol allowances for the past year and a half","12680":"The protest wasn\u2019t a one-off, but part of a decade-long struggle that has been happening in the country","12681":"In the past, LHWs have held demonstrations from Karachi and Dera Ismail Khan to Islamabad and Peshawar, demanding salaries","12682":"Over the years, the top court has taken notice and ordered the provincial and federal authorities to clear payments, but dues still remain unpaid for around 1,500 workers in Sindh alone","12683":"\u201cSalary rates are not the same for workers across provinces either,\u201d says Arain","12684":"\u201cFor the longest time, our salaries have been our means of returning loans to each other, our neighbours and family members,\u201d says Nur","12685":"\u201cWe borrow money from others and return whenever we get paid","12686":"This has been accepted as part of the LHWs\u2019 struggle ever since the programme came into being","12687":"We have kept our profession alive for the health of people","12688":"Salaries never came to us easy,\u201d she says","12689":"Community healthcare providers have been busy and an active part of Pakistan\u2019s Covid-19 response since March","12690":"For two months, the polio workers received their dues as usual; some of them also got text messages about contract renewals for May","12691":"But in the middle of Ramazan, they received another text, stating that everything was being done to ensure that the workers received their May salary before Eid, and for that to happen, all logistical equipment that they had needed to be returned to the office","12692":"What the text message failed to mention was that many of the workers were being laid off","12693":"As many as 11,000 community-based vaccination (CBV) workers in Karachi and Peshawar were affected by the termination of polio campaigns","12694":"The numerous others who were affected included area managers and managerial-level staff ensuring smooth execution of polio campaigns","12695":"A few hundred were transferred, while some were allowed to stay on","12696":"The reason given for this was that funding for the project had come to a grinding stop because of the Covid-19 pandemic","12697":"Late last month, the polio immunisation drive finally resumed in Pakistan","12698":"The drive will focus on high risk areas throughout the country","12699":"The government plans to start the campaign in these areas on a special mobile teams (SMTs) model, where campaigns run on a five-day format and workers are paid daily wages","12700":"\u201cWe will be hitting 23 union councils of Karachi in addition to selected UCs in other provinces and, as per the revised modalities, we will start and, based on the feedback, will go for a full-blown campaign later,\u201d says Dr Safdar","12701":"\u201cDistrict-level training of workers is in progress for that","12702":"\u201d\nReportedly, the workers have been asked to ensure the use of masks, sanitisers and avoid close contact with people","12703":"But the drive has not resumed in many of the UCs where many polio workers were fired","12704":"\u201cIf there are no funds for polio vaccines, then how will polio work resume in the [other] union councils of Karachi","12705":"\u201d asks a polio worker association representative, not wanting to be named","12706":"The fact that the layoffs happened during a pandemic, at a time when many of these health workers were risking their lives every day, only adds insult to injury","12707":"Polio workers report that contractor companies have been changed numerous times in the past","12708":"During these transitions, all the workers were transferred to the new group accordingly","12709":"This is the first time mass firings have taken place, overnight, with no preamble","12710":"The government claims that the previous model of community-based vaccination was not proving to be effective in these specific UCs","12711":"\u201cThe new approach [the SMT model] is to try to address the spread,\u201d says Dr Safdar","12712":"\u201cSome of my [former] colleagues have been going to houses offering to clean them,\u201d says Ghous, one of the laid-off workers","12713":"\u201cOur kids expectedly look at our faces for food","12714":"\u201dThe frontliners of one of the country\u2019s major vaccination campaigns are suffering and the diseases are waiting for no one","12715":"In June, Multan issued an alert when the polio virus was found in sewage water","12716":"So far this year, 63 wild poliovirus cases have been reported in Pakistan","12717":"The country is also among the 15 countries with the highest number of detected Covid-19 cases in the world","12718":"The battle against coronavirus has only just begun","12719":"Community healthcare providers are a massive workforce that\u2019s most likely to be involved in the upcoming, huge challenge of Covid-19 eradication in the next few years","12720":"Being part of vaccination drives in Pakistan is a dangerous job in which workers have been shot, faced abuse and denied fair compensation","12721":"The workers doing these jobs are the \u2018other\u2019 frontliners, who require the attention of the public sector","12722":"They\u2019ve been asking for their rights for years, but their pleas have not been heard","12723":"Maybe their efforts during the pandemic will finally amplify their voices","12724":"Header photo by Arif Ali\/White Star*Name

dead Miraj Ahmed, 61","12729":"The relatives of the deceased said that they had no enmity or dispute with anyone","12730":"A spokesperson for the Ahmadi community termed the killing as hate crime","12731":"He said in statement that the family was facing a hate campaign against it on social media","12732":"He said that even his employees had refused to work at his shop","12733":"A family member also confirmed that they belong to Ahmadi community","12734":"SP Waqar Azeem Kharal told Dawn that they were investigating the incident from many angles and it would premature to say something at that stage","12735":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","12736":"\u201cAnother OTT","12737":"","12738":"","12739":"\u201d; \u201cLiterally a garage start-up","12740":"\u201d; \u201cCommercials","12741":"\u201d; \u201cAksband","12742":"\u201d \u2014 my questions added themselves up in automatic succession in Seemeen and Naveed Arshad\u2019s spacey Clifton office two days before Eidul Azha","12743":"There was a good reason for me to be there","12744":"Seemeen and Naveed, husband and wife and experienced executive producers of the advertisement world, had been quietly at work on the launch of See Prime \u2014 a YouTube channel whose \u2018programming\u2019 would soon comprise a diverse collection of short-form content","12745":"The pitch was too-good to pass up checking out: See Prime, initially launching on YouTube, where it would curate audience interest, is a new contender in the very much-in-vogue OTT (Over-The-Top) media game","12746":"The three-year plan is to release a talk show on Mondays, a cooking show on Wednesdays and premiere a film-quality, original short film on Fridays","12747":"\u201cFilm-quality","12748":"\u201d \u2014 another question added itself to the conversation","12749":"Naveed Arshad had last produced Aksband, a punishing clich\u00e9-ridden horror film I had dragged a school friend to\u2026 so my initial skepticism could be excused (my friend has yet to forgive me for the experience)","12750":"The YouTube channel See Prime, open to both proven and new-blood filmmakers, is a playground of sorts for Pakistani talent with a burning desire to tell \u2018cinematic\u2019 stories\u201cAt the time I made Aksband, I didn\u2019t even know that you had to make a DCP [Digital Cinema Package \u2014 a file-format for projection] to play movies on cinema screens,\u201d Naveed tells me","12751":"Indeed he didn\u2019t, but the experience was obviously the first lesson in preparation for a bigger picture","12752":"With the exception of a handful of filmmakers \u2014 especially those from the advertisement business \u2014 no one has a grip on how to tackle long-form narratives, he tells me","12753":"See Prime, open to both proven and new-blood filmmakers, will be a playground of sorts for Pakistani talent with a burning desire to tell \u2018cinematic\u2019 stories","12754":"Naveed and Seemeen will be executive producing the content \u2014 which is fitting, since it is their primary area of expertise","12755":"The two run See\u2019Me Productions, an ad-film production company that bridges the gap between corporate clients, concept divisions at media agencies and directors","12756":"Last year, See\u2019Me delivered over 100 ad films that filled the slots between news and entertainment programmes on television","12757":"Impressive as the initiative sounds, one had to see the content to believe it \u2014 especially given the big talk this writer listens to most of the time, and the lacklustre and uneven state of digital content on both OTT\u2019s and YouTube","12758":"A drive over to the duo\u2019s apartment on the SeaView stretch did assuage my apprehension","12759":"\u201cWe didn\u2019t make a great big house, instead we made this,\u201d Seemeen tells me as we take a left from a disinfectant tunnel towards a hulking car garage painted black and gray","12760":"As foretold, it is literally a \u2018garage set-up\u2019 of a newfound business","12761":"Big, glass doors slide open as we hop over stuffed sandbags that keep the rain out","12762":"Inside, a craftily designed set of The Gentlemen Show (hosted by Ayaz Samo and Yasir Aqeel, targeting adult males) stands at the back of the shed","12763":"Steel scaffoldings, painted black to suppress light, support the barely nine-feet-high corrugated metal roofing","12764":"A big tree-bark stands concealed behind a small concrete wall reinforcing the structure","12765":"Right next to it, a white board is littered with notes of upcoming productions","12766":"This writer notes six projects in different stages of completion","12767":"Seemeen and I sit down briefly on a table that has copies of new scripts in development","12768":"It takes a minimum of six weeks to develop a screenplay, she says, and they\u2019d rather not take chances and work out the kinks at the script stage","12769":"Editing workstations are fitted in small wooden cubicles on opposite walls, where two editors trim away content for the launch of the channel","12770":"One visual effects artist composites fake smoke elements on to a smoke bomb as it crashes through a window","12771":"He has just finished replacing images on blank ultrasound monitors, in some shots of a pregnant woman","12772":"This is my introduction to See Prime\u2019s debut short film Article 370, which made its debut on August 5","12773":"As one can surmise from the title, Article 370 is a drama set in Jammu and Kashmir, starring Mariyam Nafees, Ghazala Kaifee, Abdul Muqeet and Arib, and directed by Ibrahim Baloch, a new filmmaker","12774":"Several iterations of key poster art are rejected as I preview the visually impressive trailer","12775":"The short has that elusive cinematic quality that most Pakistani films lack","12776":"No expenses have been spared, I was told earlier at their office","12777":"Actually, most of, if not all, the short films I preview, look expensive","12778":"Article 370 has been shot with an Arri Alexa","12779":"The Bridge, another short film on the edit, has been shot on a RED cinema camera","12780":"Other films in the line-up include Paying Guest and Positive, both in different stages of completion","12781":"The platform is experimenting with all genres, I\u2019m told","12782":"Soon, productions would start ramping up on episodic series as well","12783":"Frankly, no one spends this much on a start-up, I tell Naveed two days later on the

me","12785":"In any case, the platform, and the audiences\u2019 interest, will take time to warm up, Naveed explains, so there\u2019s no rush to launch an OTT","12786":"There are a number of advantages of running a free-to-view digital platform","12787":"For starters, people love free content","12788":"Secondly, it frees producers from industry politics and bad business practices","12789":"But isn\u2019t it risky, business-wise, to just invest in a medium that has very few dependable revenue models, I enquire","12790":"OTT platforms often charge a small fee that is deducted by telcos from mobile balances, or from Google Wallets linked to one\u2019s bank account","12791":"Spending millions on a short film is not viable, if one is just dependent on YouTube monetisation","12792":"The only other alternative, I assume, would be to include sponsorships in productions \u2014 an unplanned tactic Seemeen and Naveed stumbled on to during their first production

difficult to convince them to get neat haircuts","12806":"Such was the charisma of these players","12807":"How much the actions of these players\u2019 would impact us as children can also be gauged

there\u2019s the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come\u201d \u2014 William Shakespeare, HamletThere have been centuries of speculation and scrutiny regarding William Shakespeare\u2019s state of mind when he wrote these haunting verses","12865":"The play Hamlet was written in the time spanning the Elizabethan and Stuart eras of English history, which was a period of relative peace and harmony","12866":"Thus, historians theorise that the evocative and poignant verses most probably emanate from a deep personal tragedy","12867":"Considering the facts that Shakespeare is hailed as the greatest writer in the English language, and that his popularity was not posthumous, it is perplexing that most details regarding his family and relationships have been shrouded in mystery","12868":"Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s latest book Hamnet, though a work of fiction, sheds some light on the dynamics and personal tragedies that transpired within the playwright\u2019s family","12869":"The book\u2019s namesake is Shakespeare\u2019s son, who died at the age of 11, and for whom the play Hamlet was allegedly written","12870":"While no record exists as to the reason, recurrent conjecture places the child\u2019s death around the time when England was in the grip of the bubonic plague \u2014 or pestilence, as it was referred to at the time","12871":"The main protagonist of Hamnet is Shakespeare\u2019s wife Anne Hathaway, whom O\u2019Farrell renames Agnes","12872":"We know that she was eight years her husband\u2019s senior and came from a family that enjoyed a higher financial and social status than him","12873":"Their marriage produced three children: a daughter Susannah and twins Hamnet and Judith","12874":"Most commentaries and literary works depict Hathaway in a negative light, ranging from a tireless shrew to a manipulative cradle snatcher, but none of these allegations have been substantiated in any manner and thus we are left to envisage our own romantic notions","12875":"This is where we relinquish our preconceived ideas and let O\u2019Farrell take us along on a captivating journey","12876":"The author weaves a beautiful, heart-wrenching story surrounding Agnes and her children","12877":"Their individual personalities and personal dynamics intuitively bound off the pages and settle effortlessly in the reader\u2019s imagination","12878":"O\u2019Farrell writes the character of Agnes as strong-willed and wise, with full agency over her mind and body","12879":"Although a rural woman of the time, she is not portrayed as oppressed and undermined and, in her depiction, the feminist undertones in O\u2019Farrell\u2019s writing come across clear as day, without being gratuitous","12880":"Agnes is strong and tenacious, and kind and nurturing in equal measure","12881":"She cares deeply for her family and the loss of Hamnet, her only son, shatters her irreparably","12882":"Shortlisted for the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction, a historical novel attempts to take us inside the family life of the greatest writer in the English languageMeanwhile, the great Shakespeare works and lives in London, earning much success and recognition","12883":"His theatre group is enjoying the Golden Age of English history, when literature and poetry flourished","12884":"On account of their separate living situation, many historians postulate a fair amount of discord in their marriage; however this theory is negated as he visited his family for long periods of time and chose to spend his last days at his family home in Stratford-upon-Avon rather than in London","12885":"The bubonic plague is the indubitable villain in this story","12886":"Obliterating a quarter of the population of London and a third of Europe\u2019s population, it destroys the rich and the poor with equal ferocity","12887":"The thriving playhouses are forced to shut their doors frequently as the Black Death ravages the country and life comes to a shattering halt","12888":"Hamnet\u2019s twin sister Judith gets sick first and is carefully tended to by the family","12889":"Meanwhile, unbeknownst to all, life slips away from her brother\u2019s grasp","12890":"It is said that, even though word was hastily sent out regarding the child\u2019s dire condition, Shakespeare couldn\u2019t make it back in time","12891":"We are not privy to the actual, historical details of this incident, but as a parent, one doesn\u2019t need to really imagine what emotional and mental turmoil must have ensued when, upon his arrival, he finds his son deceased","12892":"In O\u2019Farrell\u2019s book, Agnes describes the sound he makes as \u201cthat of an animal forced to bear a great weight","12893":"\u201d This sound stays with her, and she can recall its exact \u201cpitch and timbre\u201d till the day she dies","12894":"It is speculated that most of Shakespeare\u2019s works prior to this devastating event were comedies or tragicomedies","12895":"Hamlet \u2014 as a name it was often used interchangeably with Hamnet \u2014 was written to honour his son and the torturous, foreboding nature of the play was a reflection of Shakespeare\u2019s anguished soul","12896":"Reading Hamnet during our current state of uncertainty and lockdown gives one a better insight and perspective into how it must have been to live during the time of the plague","12897":"With no technology and media outlets at their disposal, humanity must have truly felt the full menace of isolation and solitude","12898":"Praise be to O\u2019Farrell for tackling heavy subjects such as death, disease and familial dynamics with skill and sensitivity","12899":"The reader lives moment by moment, immersed in the complex, layered characters she has created and their seemingly ordinary lives","12900":"Yet, in this ordinary story we witness an extraordinary love of a mother for her child, of a bereft sibling yearning for her twin, of a father unable to protect his son from the Black Death","12901":"O\u2019Farrell\u2019s writing is exceptional and wins us over from the very first page","12902":"No wonder, then, that Hamnet has been shortlisted for this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction","12903":"The author creates vivid, verdant landscapes coupled with muted, suffering characters, but there are no heightened dramatics, no exaggerated emotions","12904":"Hamnet, at its heart, is a story of a family\u2019s bereavement at the loss of a child, showing how one ill-fated event can cause an entire family to collapse irrevocably","12905":"Anyone who enjoys historical fiction will love this book for its engrossing narrative and the masterful prose","12906":"The review is co-founder of My Bookshelf, an online

Pakistan in the first Test at Old Trafford on Saturday","12913":"England were struggling in pursuit of a victory target of 277 after collapsing to 117-5 on the fourth day","12914":"But Woakes, who had helped drag England back into the match with 2-11 in just five overs late Friday, and fellow World Cup winner Jos Buttler turned the tide with a stand of 139","12915":"Nevertheless, with just 21 more runs needed, Buttler was lbw for 75 after trying to reverse-sweep leg-spinner Yasir Shah","12916":"The batsman reviewed but all to no avail, with England now 256-6","12917":"By the time Pakistan left-arm fast bowler Shaheen Afridi took the new ball, England needed just 13 more runs to win at a sun-drenched Old Trafford","12918":"But there was still time for England to lose their seventh wicket when, with four more needed, Stuart Broad was plumb lbw on the sweep to Yasir","12919":"Woakes, however, finished the match with an edged boundary off Afridi down to the third man rope as England went 1-0 up in a three-match campaign","12920":"Victory meant England had won an opening Test for the first time in six series","12921":"Defeat was tough on Yasir, who took eight wickets in the match","12922":"Wicketkeeper Buttler had had a poor game in the field, twice missing Shan Masood on 45 during the Pakistan opener's 156 that was instrumental in leaving England with a first-innings deficit of over a hundred runs","12923":"But whether it was cover-driving leg-spinner Shadab Khan or pulling teenage paceman Naseem Shah for another boundary, Buttler put the pressure back on Pakistan","12924":"Buttler's fifty came off just 55 balls, with seven fours, with Woakes no slouch in a 59-ball fifty he completed by cover-driving Naseem for the eighth boundary of his innings","12925":"It was Woakes's highest Test score since his hundred against India two years ago","12926":"Although Woakes is known to be vulnerable to the short ball, Pakistan did not pitch short to the all-rounder until he was well set","12927":"Only twice has a team chased more than 200 to win in the fourth innings of a Test at Old Trafford, with England making 294-4 against New Zealand in 2008 and 231-3 against the West Indies in 2004","12928":"Earlier, England lost four wickets for 31 runs in slipping to 117-5, with captain Joe Root and Ben Stokes both falling in the collapse","12929":"The slump started when Dom Sibley (36) edged a drive off Yasir to slip","12930":"Root made 42 before he nicked Naseem to Babar Azam in the slips","12931":"Stokes had guided England to an astounding one-wicket win over Australia from a seemingly hopeless position with a brilliant century in the third Ashes Test last year","12932":"But there was no repeat of his Headingley heroics on Saturday when he fell for just nine, with wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, impressive behind the stumps throughout this match, holding an excellent catch after Stokes got a thin glove to a Yasir googly that bounced","12933":"Ollie Pope then received a brute of a delivery from Afridi that lept off a length, the ball ballooning to Shadab as he ran forward from gully","12934":"Pakistan had resumed on 137-8, a lead of 244","12935":"Yasir led a tailend rally that saw 32 runs added in just 16 balls before his team were dismissed for 169 in their second innings","12936":"Yasir struck a quickfire 33 off 24 balls but, in the end, it was not enough to compensate for Pakistan losing four wickets late on Friday","12937":"Brief scores: Pakistan 1st Innings: 326 (Shan Masood 156, Babar Azam 69; S Broad 3-54, J Archer 3-59) England 1st Innings: 219 (O Pope 62; Yasir Shah 4-66) Pakistan 2nd Innings: 169 (S Broad 3-37) England 2nd Innings: 277-7 (C Woakes 84 no, J Buttler 75; Yasir

Rs770  million on the treatment of the confirmed virus patients, purchase of medicines and personal protective equipment, establishment of call centres and rapid response teams, hospital waste management, and testing through private laboratories","12940":"It, however, said it was not possible for it to produce the details of spending per Covid-19 patient","12941":"Dawn learned from a member of the finance minister\u2019s team on condition of anonymity that over Rs2 billion had so far been spent on the treatment of Covid-19 patients across the province and of the amount, Rs770 million was provided by the provincial government and the rest by donor agencies","12942":"Assembly legislates to reduce term of KPPSC members by two yearsThe house also approved an amendment to the KP Public Service Commission Ordinance, 1978, reducing the tenure of the commission\u2019s members from five years to three years","12943":"However, the amendment moved by law minister Sultan Mohammad Khan, will not apply to the current chairman and members of the commission","12944":"Meanwhile, the speaker expressed annoyance at the absence of officials of the excise and taxation, tourism and home departments from the session and summoned their secretaries","12945":"\u201cIt is a highly irresponsible attitude of the high-ups of these departments that questions related to them are on the house\u2019s agenda but no official is in attendance,\u201d he said","12946":"The speaker also directed the government departments to submit response to the questions of MPAs to the assembly\u2019s secretariat within two weeks","12947":"He said the departments took months and sometime a year to respond to the lawmakers\u2019 queries","12948":"\u201cThe members seek important information about matters of public importance","12949":"However, as the government department provide the information after a delay of months, it is of no use,\u201d he said","12950":"Mr Ghani said the lawmakers had the right to table privilege motions against the relevant secretaries over the failure of government departments to produce the sought-after information within two weeks","12951":"During the last three sittings of the house, the speaker had issued directives to the chief secretary and secretaries of government departments to ensure the presence of one additional secretary in the house for responding to the questions, but to no avail","12952":"The speaker annoyed when the questions of a few lawmakers were placed on the agenda for the day but the relevant department had not submitted their reply","12953":"Pakistan Peoples Party member Nighat Orakzai complained that secretaries of the government departments didn\u2019t take the house seriously","12954":"The chair adjourned the session until Monday","12955":"Published in Dawn, August 8th, 2020","12956":"Pakistan\u2019s population is forecast to almost double in the next 30 years","12957":"That means we will have another 200 million mouths to feed by 2050","12958":"On top of rapid population growth, the changing climate or global warming is bringing new challenges to the nation\u2019s food security \u2014 a total of 21m people in the country are already estimated to be acutely food insecure at present","12959":"Being among the 10 countries affected most by climate change, Pakistan is on track to become the most water-stressed nations in the region by 2040","12960":"This will result in significant shortages of surface water availability for irrigation, industry and human consumption","12961":"According to the United Nation\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), the number of extreme climate-related disasters have more than doubled since the 1990s with an average of 213 of these events occurring every year from 1990 through 2016, affecting agricultural productivity and causing harvest losses","12962":"For example, unusual temperature and humidity during the summer of 2019 had resulted in widespread harvest losses across cotton, rice and maize crops across much of Punjab and Sindh","12963":"Leveraging drone technology alone will enable farmers to increase their productivity through improved pest managementAgriculture is the mainstay of Pakistan\u2019s economy, accounting for almost a fifth of the economy and 42 per cent of the workforce in 2019","12964":"The total cropped area amounts to 23","12965":"4m hectares and is primarily worked by smallholders averaging 6","12966":"4 acres per farm","12967":"Of all arable land, 52pc is irrigated, accounting for more than 90pc of overall agriculture productivity","12968":"However, in spite of being a substantial part of the national economy, agriculture productivity is declining, impeding economic growth and causing food security concerns","12969":"Faced with these challenges, it is critical that Pakistan starts embracing modern agriculture technology and innovation to protect and enhance the natural resource base while increasing productivity","12970":"Globally, the agriculture sector is at the cusp of a technology revolution","12971":"Modern farms and agricultural operations work far differently than those a few decades ago owing to the use of technologies including sensors, devices, machines and information technology","12972":"Today agriculture routinely uses sophisticated technologies such as robots, drones, temperature and moisture sensors, advanced gene editing, digital agriculture, etc","12973":"These advanced devices and precision agriculture allow businesses to be more profitable, efficient, safer and environmentally friendly","12974":"These technologies are ready to fuel the next wave of innovation in agriculture around the world and help farmers meet challenges posed by climate change, water scarcity and the burgeoning population","12975":"The FAO estimates that the Internet of Things (IoT) can help increase agricultural productivity by 70pc by 2050","12976":"The technology, when scaled across Pakistan\u2019s smallholder geography, can help farmers optimise the use of inputs and scarce resources they have for improved yields and greater profits, says Dr Muhammad Awais, a professor from the Lahore University of Management Sciences","12977":"\u201cSimilarly, a gene-editing technique using Crispr has untapped potential for greater crop productivity, enhanced nutritional value, reduce food wastage and climate resilience","12978":"In Pakistan\u2019s context, small farmers are significantly more affected by insufficient information, unpredictable weather changes, soil erosion, yield loss due to pests and insects, and increase in input and cultivation costs","12979":"Therefore, technology adoption is even more essential for the transformation of agriculture","12980":"The use of high-yield crops resistant to disease, pests and adverse weather conditions can potentially help alleviate poverty, conserve the environment and ensure food security","12981":"\u201dPakistan, unfortunately, has dragged its feet when it comes to embracing new technologies","12982":"While other developing economies have embraced innovation in agriculture, we are still rooted in traditional farming","12983":"The recent locust attack highlights this widening gap between Pakistan and progressive economies; while the world has shifted to unmanned aerial vehicles to combat these situations, Pakistan hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with the pace of modern technology","12984":"Even with biotechnology, despite heavy public-sector investment for research and education of the technology, formal commercialisation of biotech crops remains a distant reality due to policy disconnects at various levels of the government","12985":"Dr Yousuf Zafar, former chairman of the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), stresses the need for adopting a more sustainable and technologically advanced approach to agriculture","12986":"\u201cWe must adopt practices involving sustainable use of our natural resources, allowing farmers to grow more with less","12987":"Technologies such as laser land levelling, solar-powered high-efficiency irrigation systems, smart water grids and drones need to be promoted for precision agriculture and higher productivity","12988":"Leveraging drone technology in agriculture alone will enable farmers to increase their productivity through improved pest management and increased precision owing to their increasing applications, such as aerial mapping, plant health monitoring, soil analysis and weed detection","12989":"\u201dExperts argue that the potential of technological advancement in agriculture remains untapped owing to the absence of an overarching legislative and policy framework and an outdated regulatory regime","12990":"The changes in technology have far outpaced changes in the regulatory and legislative frameworks, and the regulatory regimes are inefficient and lack adequate resources","12991":"This has discouraged private sector investment in research and development and enhanced barriers to entry for new agriculture technologies","12992":"Public sector institutions lack financial and technical resources for research and development and are ill-equipped to keep pace with rapidly changing industry landscape, says Dr Zafar","12993":"Moreover, the rate of technology adoption has been slow and lacks innovative approach towards local adaptation with archaic marketing systems and subsidy operations incentivising subsistence farming practices, limiting investment in commercial agriculture due to such value chain distortions","12994":"\u201cSadly, the importance of sustainable agriculture has not been a mainstream theme in the prevailing policy discourse, resulting in overall neglect by policymakers,\u201d the former PARC chairman argues","12995":"With the pace of technological advancements in agriculture reaching an unprecedented level, an enabling business environment must be created in the country for timely adoption of new and novel technologies to boost agriculture as well as encourage innovation and attracts meaningful investments in research","12996":"A strong and stable policy, legal and regulatory framework would provide an environment to facilitate long-term investment and technology transfer by firms and other innovation actors","12997":"The government must ensure that the prevailing legal framework is evolving with new innovations and technologies","12998":"Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, August

province\u201d because of the rampant violations of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the markets after it lifted the lockdown in the province","13000":"The government, taking notice of relaxed attitude of the administration and police towards enforcement of the Covid SOPs in the markets, shopping malls and plazas in province, told the commissioners and the RPOs to follow the official guidelines to prevent resurgence of the deadly virus which has played havoc all over the world","13001":"The province-wide alert was issued amid some disturbing reports that the virus which was on the decline these days, could resurge if preventive measures were not taken, particularly in view of mourners gathering in the upcoming month of Muharram","13002":"An official privy to the development said the health experts, doctors and researchers had warned the Punjab government that at a time when the pandemic\u2019s first wave was not yet over, a second wave could be devastating if the SOPs were not followed in letter and spirit","13003":"The threat was more potent for the provincial capital that had been on the top among the coronavirus hotspots in the province, reporting the highest number of deaths and confirmed cases","13004":"\u201cEven though the Covid-19 cases are on the decline, the public health threat still exists and the disease may spread again if adequate precautions are not taken\u201d, reads a letter of the primary & secondary healthcare department, Punjab","13005":"Addressed to all the RPOs and the divisional commoners of the province, the letter was written by P&SHD Secretary retired Capt Mohamamd Usman on Thursday, following serious complaints regarding non-compliance of the Punjab government\u2019s SOPs to curtail the virus","13006":"Showing his serious reservations about the \u2018negligent behaviour of the senior officers\u2019 during the crisis, he emphasised on the Punjab government\u2019s SOPs to help eradicate the virus","13007":"\u201cIt has been observed that the SOPs in the markets, shopping malls, and plazas are not being followed and implementation activities have also slowed down\u201d, reads the letter","13008":"It further states that the Punjab government has allowed reopening of various sectors subject to observance of the SOPs","13009":"\u201cFurthermore, this department\u2019s order dated June 20 regarding use of face covering at all public places, during travel and conduct of any business, private or official, is still intact and face covering is mandatory to curb the spread of Covid-19\u201d, reads the letter","13010":"While hinting at the possibility of a second wave of the virus, the secretary stressed the need to adhere to the guidelines to acknowledge the efforts of the Punjab government which slowed down the Covid-19 spread across the province","13011":"\u201cForegoing in view, it is requested that the compliance of SOPs and face covering usage to prevent Covid-19 spread may be ensured in true letter and spirit to avoid a second wave of the virus in Punjab\u201d, the letter concludes","13012":"Meanwhile, 150 new cases of the virus were reported during the last 24 hours in the province, while two deaths from Covid-19 also occurred during the same period in Punjab","13013":"According to the figures released by the P&SHD on Thursday, 47 new cases were reported from Lahore where the total number of the confirmed cases reached 48,076","13014":"Similarly, two more deaths were also reported in Lahore where the virus has so far claimed lives

wave of peaceful demonstrations over President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s disputed re-election and an ensuing brutal police crackdown","13018":"Russia claimed the protests were being orchestrated from abroad to destabilise its ex-Soviet neighbour while European countries condemned police violence and backed fresh sanctions against Lukashenko","13019":"Men and women, many wearing white and holding flowers, took to the streets of the capital Minsk to protest against police brutality during four nights of unrest since Sunday\u2019s vote","13020":"Lukashenko\u2019s opponents accuse him of rigging the election to defeat his main rival, popular opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has left the ex-Soviet country for neighbouring Lithuania","13021":"Protesters took to the streets across the country to contest the vote results but police used stun grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, water cannon and, in at least one case, live fire to disperse protesters","13022":"At least two people have died and hundreds have been wounded in the violence while nearly 7,000 have been arrested","13023":"On Thursday, some demonstrators held placards reading

completed the groundwork in China to probe the origins of the new coronavirus \u2014 as it warned there might never be a  \u201csilver bullet\u201d for Covid-19","13045":"WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged governments and citizens to focus on known basic steps to suppress the pandemic, such as testing, contact tracing, maintaining physical distance and wearing a mask","13046":"\u201cWe all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection,\u201d Tedros told a virtual press conference","13047":"\u201cHowever, there\u2019s no silver bullet at the moment \u2014 and there might never be","13048":"\u201cThe basics of public health\u201d are most effective for now, Tedros added, saying that wearing a mask in particular was sending a  \u201cpowerful message to those around you that we are all in this together\u201d","13049":"Infections are surging in some countries around the world, but Tedros insisted that however bad the situation was, past examples such as South Korea showed it could be turned around","13050":"\u201cWhen leaders step up and work intensely with their populations, this disease can be brought under control,\u201d he said","13051":"The WHO began pressing China in early May to invite in its experts to help investigate the animal origins of Covid-19","13052":"The UN health agency sent an epidemiologist and an animal health specialist to Beijing on July 10 to lay the groundwork for a probe aimed at identifying how the virus entered the human species","13053":"Their scoping mission is now complete, said Tedros","13054":"\u201cThe WHO advance team that travelled to China has now concluded their mission,\u201d he said","13055":"Tedros said WHO and Chinese experts had agreed the terms of reference and a programme of work for a WHO-led international team of scientists and researchers from around the world","13056":"\u201cEpidemiological studies will begin in Wuhan to identify the potential source of infection of the early cases,\u201d he said","13057":"Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, possibly from a market in the city of Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat","13058":"WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan paid tribute to the work already done by Chinese experts but stressed that the search for the disease\u2019s origin would require much deeper study","13059":"\u201cThere are gaps in the epidemiologic landscape, and what is required is going to be a much more extensive, retrospective epidemiologic study to look at those first cases and clusters in Wuhan and to fully understand the links between those cases,\u201d he said","13060":"From there,  \u201cwe can then determine at what point, in Wuhan or elsewhere, the animal-species barrier was breached","13061":"\u201d Ryan said that without detailed investigations, the search would be like looking for a needle in a haystack","13062":"\u201cThe real trick is to go to the human clusters that occurred first and then to work your way back, systematically looking for that first signal\u201d where the virus jumped species, the Irish epidemiologist said","13063":"Published in Dawn, August 4th, 2020","13064":"THE point where the PML-N search engine rammed into the NAB wall in Lahore the other day is called Thokar for a reason","13065":"Thokar here probably signifies an abrupt rise in ground level, a jump that encouraged diversion of the river","13066":"It would take some imagination to liken the recent momentum of PML-N politics with the flow of a genuine, breathing river, but maybe it can be compared with the Ravi, the abandoned Iravati, which gave Lahore its lifeline and which has been the subject of some fancy civilisational schemes by the rulers since its tragic strangulation","13067":"The direction of the party cut off from its fountainhead Mian Nawaz Sharif has been as uncertain as that of a river that is supposed to have already run its course","13068":"As symbols go, the appearance of Ms Maryam Nawaz at Thokar Niaz Beg on Monday could have suggested a change of direction, a tactical twist","13069":"But did it with all the intense scenes that were acted out close to the NAB premises that morning","13070":"Three days later, Lahore is still trying to figure out what had actually happened during that clash","13071":"There are accusations and counter accusations and police cases","13072":"The reporters on the beat say NAB has another case now to summon and frustrate the PML-N stalwarts with","13073":"However, like most such cases, a truth which will satisfy even the most neutral souls will never be known","13074":"A few things are easy to assume","13075":"That a political party is inclined and fully entitled to having a show of strength as one of its leaders appears before the law in a high-profile case","13076":"That there is bound to be a display of unbridled sentiment at such an event, and there\u2019s this danger always of the emotion spilling over into the danger zone","13077":"The PML-N was torn between the urge to seize the moment and not irk the authorities beyond a certain limit","13078":"It is also expected at such moments of heightened political activity that a battery of top politicians belonging to the party will be there","13079":"Expectantly, each one of them will be jostling to be photographed with the prosecuted and persecuted leader","13080":"Also, usually the organisers have a fair idea how strong a demonstration they intend it to be","13081":"In this latest instance, it would again be unrealistic and actually apolitical to argue that anyone from the PML-N to the NAB, whose job as an accountability force ultimately is to make an example of the powerful, wanted it to be a quiet start of the week meeting","13082":"Both of them would have wanted to grab the headlines, but given the up-and-down intensity of the PML-N\u2019s tone, the message that filters through is that they discovered things to be a little overdone","13083":"That or there was a sudden change of heart and strategy by the PML-N after the violence involving its workers","13084":"It is clear that from a certain point onwards, the PML-N was torn between the urge to seize the moment for mass political capital and the old principle of not irking the authorities beyond a limit","13085":"The result showed up in a confused, halfhearted display of politics starring a long-promised new leader","13086":"Analysts, led by Punjab minister Fayyaz Chohan, said the gap between the politics of Mr Shahbaz Sharif and Ms Maryam Nawaz was there for everyone to see, and they were not wrong","13087":"What was worse for those who may have hoped for this to be some kind of a launching, finally, of Ms Maryam, was that Shahbaz Sharif still had a good presence","13088":"The misadventure at Thokar was proof of the dangerously impossible situations that defiant posturing could lead to","13089":"It was a confirmation that caution is the best policy","13090":"It seemed to be an error, a half measure and a scream suppressed by the unpopular fear that could cost any other political party","13091":"In this particular instance, it may have been shrugged off by some given the particular non-eccentric brand that is forever associated with the PML-N","13092":"But there are voices which say the change is a must and if Ms Maryam cannot bring in the necessary shifts who else can","13093":"It took her ages to emerge from behind the curtain","13094":"The longer she stayed away from public view the greater was the expectation naturally","13095":"The suspense cast her as someone who was included in the cast but whose entry was delayed for maximum impact","13096":"The hardcore PML-N cadres could not be faulted for believing that she was the crucial card in the pack that could take the game to a whole new level","13097":"It appears that Ms Maryam and her party have allowed the excitement created by the Thokar incident to fizzle out all too quickly","13098":"In fact, unlike some other opposition politicians, some of them even owing allegiance to the PML-N, Ms Maryam failed the important histrionics test","13099":"She came out as rather weak, and the footage of the whole episode betrayed that her grooming team appeared more prepared for the camera rather than the possibility of her having to break into an impassioned speech","13100":"There is this bit of information provided by a most reliable journalist in Lahore who says Ms Maryam was constantly taking directions from Mian Nawaz Sharif","13101":"With an experienced coach like her dad there\u2019s little room for anyone else offering her any advice, barring perhaps asking her: what is it actually that she aims to do","13102":"Pakistanis have spent so much time and energy trying to dissuade people such as Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari from taking in-family counsel seriously","13103":"Perhaps Thokar on Aug 10, 2020, could have unveiled a new independent-thinking, a touch rebellious, a wee bit angry new leader worth wooing","13104":"","13105":"","13106":"As usual the groove is just too comfortable for the family heir to want to come out of it","13107":"One appearance every few months and a lot of respect and devotion and loyalty in the bargain","13108":"This is a very convenient deal, royalty-like","13109":"If this is the image that is craved","13110":"The writer is Dawn\u2019s resident editor in Lahore","13111":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","13112":"WITH the last hitch removed, the elusive intra-Afghan dialogue is now likely to take place next week to discuss the country\u2019s political future that could bring an end to the two-decade-long American war in Afghanistan","13113":"It will be the most critical phase of the Afghan peace process with the representatives of the Kabul government for the first time sitting face to face with the Taliban leadership","13114":"President Ashraf Ghani last week passed an order to release the remaining batch of 400 Afghan Taliban prisoners thus clearing the final hurdle for the start of the negotiations between the two sides","13115":"The Feb 29 peace accord between the Taliban and the United States had pledged to release 5,000 insurgent prisoners","13116":"While releasing most of the detainees, the government in Kabul was reluctant to free what it described as hardcore fighters; 156 of these prisoners had been sentenced to death","13117":"The president\u2019s consent came after a consultative assembly or Loya Jirga, which met last week, gave its approval","13118":"There was also American pressure behind the move","13119":"It\u2019s apparent that the Trump administration does not want any delay in its plan to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan","13120":"In fact, the drawdown of US troops had started soon after the signing of the peace deal between the US and the Taliban","13121":"The number of American troops has now dropped to approximately 8,600 from about 13,000 and five bases have been closed in Afghanistan","13122":"In a situation where two sides have long been locked in war, it\u2019s never easy to agree to a political transition","13123":"The US secretary of defence last week said another 3,600 soldiers would be brought home by November leaving less than 5,000 in Afghanistan","13124":"But the complete withdrawal of US troops is linked to an intra-Afghan agreement on a future political set-up","13125":"Indeed, the stakes are high for both sides of the divide","13126":"While an agreement would raise the prospects for peace, a breakdown in talks could deepen the civil war","13127":"It\u2019s not just about a power-sharing arrangement, it is also about a future political system in the country and protection of fundamental rights of all sections of the population","13128":"The outcome of the talks would largely depend on whether or not the Taliban are willing to accept a pluralistic political order","13129":"Curiously, the Taliban recently announced some changes in their negotiating team bringing in Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of Mullah Omar, the late supreme leader of the militia","13130":"He had earlier been appointed to the pivotal post of chief of the Taliban\u2019s military operations","13131":"His rise in the Taliban hierarchy is seen as significant given his reputation as a hardliner","13132":"The new Taliban team also includes Anas Haqqani the younger brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the insurgent group","13133":"The Kabul government last year in exchange for two American and one Australian nationals held by the Taliban, released the younger Haqqani who was in a death cell in a Kabul prison","13134":"Another significant addition to the team is the former chief justice in the ousted Taliban regime","13135":"Led by Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the rest are the same representatives who were there in the peace talks with the US","13136":"According to some analysts, the changes in the Taliban negotiating team have made it more representative of the group\u2019s political and military leadership","13137":"On the other side, while former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah would direct the peace negotiations with the Taliban, the Afghan team in the talks would reportedly be led by Masoom Stanekzai, a former head of the Afghan intelligence agency NDS","13138":"He was forced to resign in 2019, following an extrajudicial killing of four Afghan civilians during a night raid carried out by the agency personnel in Jalalabad","13139":"Stanekzai had earlier served as secretary of the High Peace Council, which was set up by the Afghan government to talk to the Taliban in the past","13140":"He would be reporting to and take direction from a Council headed by Dr Abdullah","13141":"In a situation where two sides have long been locked in war, it\u2019s never easy to negotiate peace and agree to a political transition","13142":"More importantly, the talks will be taking place in an atmosphere of heightened hostilities","13143":"Since the signing of the peace accord with the US earlier this year, the Taliban have intensified their attacks on Afghan security forces in order to expand the areas under their influence","13144":"It also seems a part of Taliban strategy to gain advantage at the negotiating table","13145":"For negotiations to move forward, it will be imperative for the two sides to agree to a ceasefire and lower the level of hostilities","13146":"It remains to be seen whether the Taliban will show the same degree of pragmatism as their leaders had done during peace negotiations with the US","13147":"The Eid ceasefire certainly helped create better conditions for negotiations","13148":"But continued violence could make it extremely difficult for the talks to progress","13149":"For many Afghans, any prospect of the Taliban even sharing power is disconcerting","13150":"Notwithstanding their solemn pledges, the Taliban have maintained a deliberate ambiguity about their political agenda, adding to the sense of confusion","13151":"There were some indications that the conservative Islamist movement would be willing to work within a pluralistic political system","13152":"Yet, there has not been any clarity on whether or not the group would be willing to work within a democratic political and constitutional set-up","13153":"Another cause of concern is the protection of women\u2019s rights to education and work","13154":"Although the Taliban leaders said they acknowledged women\u2019s rights and would not oppose female education, this assurance has not helped remove concerns","13155":"Surely, the Taliban political leadership appears more moderate and flexible in its view while talking about a pluralistic and inclusive political system","13156":"However, mere words are not enough","13157":"Indeed, the latest development clearing the way for intra-Afghan talks is very positive","13158":"But both sides will now have to show seriousness in finding a political solution to the festering Afghan conflict","13159":"The writer is an author and journalist","13160":"zhussain100@yahoo","13161":"comTwitter: @hidhussainPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","13162":"After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh rule in Punjab was in doldrums due to palace intrigues and infighting","13163":"However, it continued to expand from Amritsar to Peshawar on account of a strong and professional army that it had at its command","13164":"One feature of this army was the many European Generals whom Ranjit Singh had acquired after the 1815 battle of Waterloo, following which, these Generals had migrated to Iran and further east","13165":"These Generals trained Ranjit Singh's army on modern warfare, especially his 'Fauj i Khaas' brigade, which can be compared to some sort of a special services group","13166":"General Jean-Baptiste Ventura was among those European Generals, and for those who do not know, he used to reside in what is now the Chief Secretary's office in Civil Secretariat Lahore","13167":"Peshawar was also under the control of Sikhs, with Italian General Paolo Avitabile (known as Abu Tabela) residing at the site of Gor Khatri","13168":"He ruled the city by throwing people off the minarets of Masjid Mahabat Khan as a mark of terror","13169":"At that time, communities of various tribes were settled around Peshawar and Sikh forces were stationed some 30 or so kilometres from it at the Shabqadar fort in Mohmand agency","13170":"They were also tasked with controlling the tribal factions and communities","13171":"One night, in the year 1840, tribesmen from Mohmand attacked the fort and were able to break the huge wooden gates at its main entrance","13172":"This was followed by a slaughter of Sikh forces that were stationed at the fort after which the tribesmen withdrew from the battleground","13173":"Lahore Darbar was infuriated, so a court was established under the leadership of General Maan Singh and General Ventura to fix responsibility for the disastrous breach","13174":"The two conducted an investigation for two days and concluded that it was the criminal negligence of the wooden gates that led to the disaster","13175":"The Sikh General assisted by General Ventura decreed a hundred-year imprisonment to the huge willow gates for dereliction of duty","13176":"The gates were plank-cuffed with heavy chains to the main observation tower at the fort","13177":"The gates' punishment legally ended in 1940 but no one relieved them and they remain chained to this date","13178":"It is rumored that when Bhutto visited the fort in the 1970s, he tried to prevail as prime minister for the release of the condemned gates but to no avail","13179":"Shabqadar is a small town an hour out of Peshawar and on the borders of Mohmand","13180":"It is regarded as a region that has always held strategic value when it comes to keeping peace in Peshawar","13181":"Along with it come the various tribes who have historically been independent-minded and governments have had to maintain peace through a policy of continuous negotiations with them","13182":"And as the Sikhs and later the British ruled the area, they established many forts in the region in order to gain some space to prepare at the time of attacks","13183":"Shabqadar fort was one such fort established by the Sikhs in Mohmand in 1837","13184":"The fort today works as a training centre for the Frontier Constabulary and is maintained well by the forces deployed there","13185":"It is an efficient location from an operational point of view and the FC has also been able to preserve its historic character","13186":"As we entered the fort, the friendly hosts took as to 'Churchill's room', where Winston Churchill spent few days as a war correspondent in 1897 during the great tribal uprising","13187":"The room features Churchill's bed and room chairs","13188":"There is also an old manual sheet fan","13189":"And the walls adorn photographs from the time and some artefacts","13190":"The fort also boasts a small museum with artefacts from the last two hundred years","13191":"These are mainly military equipment, including gazails (ancient rifles), binoculars, mortar guns etc","13192":"Such museums and places have the unique capacity to transport you into those bygone eras and make you wonder how tough life must have been at the time for all parties","13193":"Next we found ourselves standing before the good old condemned willow gate under arrest since 1840","13194":"The three-metre-high black door leans against the observation tower in the middle of the fort, telling a story of 200 years, of the rule of Sikhs, British and now of Muslims","13195":"Nothing much has changed for the condemned gates","13196":"The tablet next to the gates reads: \"The weeping willows: In the winter of 1840, a Mohmand Lashkar (war party) succeeded in breaking down these gates","13197":"The then Sikh Maharaja Sher Singh (Ranjit Singh son) had them court martialed for treason","13198":"The French General Jean Ventura headed the proceedings which lasted two days, having found them guilty as charged, the gates were sentenced to 100 years' imprisonment","13199":"They are languishing enchained ever since","13200":"\"  At the time, the tall observation tower was used to monitor the surroundings and perhaps functioned as a great source of information for impending attacks from the tribesmen","13201":"The tower adorns many commemorative plaques from colonial times, celebrating fallen comrades, mostly the ones who died from cholera or sunstroke","13202":"We walked from the observation tower to FC's officers' mess","13203":"The messes of these historic units are always a treat to explore as they give you a history lesson

Karachi","13217":"While I loved all the food, my most favourite dish was called pan fried noodles","13218":"I remember my parents ordering it, and because the thin noodles were so crisp, you actually had to cut into the dish with a knife to carve out everyone\u2019s share","13219":"And if you didn\u2019t eat your noodles fast enough, the delicious sauce poured over the top would make them somewhat soggy","13220":"In China, where this dish originated, pan fried noodles is sometimes called liang mian huang, meaning \u2018two-faced pan fried noodles\u2019, since they are crisp on both sides","13221":"Other times, it is referred to as the \u2018king of the noodle\u2019, depending on where you are eating","13222":"You could add any meat or seafood of your choice and definitely vegetables","13223":"The noodles are thin, crisp and cooked golden on the outside and soft on the inside","13224":"Getting it right is always a challenge","13225":"When I first moved to New York, I searched in vain at local restaurants for pan fried noodles, and was sad to find that not many offered this dish","13226":"What I didn\u2019t know then was that the majority of Chinese restaurants in the US were \u2018fast food\u2019 restaurants, and they were not familiar with pan fried noodles","13227":"They also catered more to the American palate, and were likely to stir fry noodles rather than fry them crisp","13228":"In search of authentic food, you would need to make your way to Chinatown","13229":"There, you\u2019ll find large bowls of soup with meat and vegetables, fish and tofu,

other items","13235":"In my mind, perhaps it was like another Karachi","13236":"To make a really good pan fried noodles dish, look for thin egg noodles, and cook them in boiling water for only two to three minutes (or you will overcook them)","13237":"And, be sure to rinse them in cold water and leave them in a colander to drain completely","13238":"Your noodles must have zero water on them afterwards","13239":"And your sauce must be flavourful, or you won\u2019t appreciate the dish very much","13240":"You must be ready for the recipe, now that I\u2019ve whetted your

accordingly","13252":"Put two serving spoons of oil in it, on a medium to high stove","13253":"When the oil becomes hot, put the noodles in, and let them fry","13254":"Move them around intermittently,

Aurangzeb\u2019s 35th regnal year, the Sufi-scholar Shaikh Qutb al Din begins preparing to teach his many students after finishing his morning prayers at his residence in Sehali in Bara Banki, Lucknow","13314":"Just two hours into his lessons, the entire premises is suddenly surrounded by armed men","13315":"They break in through the walls and unleash mayhem inside","13316":"Shaikh Qutb al Din is brutally murdered, sustaining one wound from gunshot, one from an axe and seven from a sword","13317":"The tragic details are recorded on a document (mahzar) bearing the testimony of no less than 75 witnesses, to be presented to the emperor","13318":"Aurangzeb promises quick retribution and, in compensation for their loss, grants the sons a property in Lucknow \u2014 an abandoned haveli [mansion] that once belonged to a French indigo merchant and which would go on to house one of Islamic South Asia\u2019s most distinguished families of scholars and saints: Farangi Mahal","13319":"These are the rather gory beginnings of the eponymous Farangi Mahallis, whose ancestors had settled in North India much earlier in the 14th century","13320":"One of Akbar\u2019s earliest extant farmaans or royal decrees (the young emperor was only 17 at the time) is thus a revenue-free land grant (madad-i-ma\u2019ash) to Mullah Hafiz, the great-grandfather of the murdered Qutb al Din Sihalvi","13321":"One of the four sons of Shaikh Qutb al Din \u2014 Mullah Nizam al Din \u2014 in turn immortalised his own name and that of his family by introducing the Dars-i-Nizami, which was destined to become one of the most widely taught educational curricula in the madressahs of South Asia to this day","13322":"The publication by the scholar Khushtar Noorani of a tazkira [biographical memoirs] of the Farangi Mahallis is thus a welcome development in the process of bringing to light the vast spiritual and intellectual riches of our forebears","13323":"Titled Ulema-i- Farangi Mahal, the tazkira was originally penned in Arabic by Maulana Abd al Bari Farangi Mahalli (1878-1926) in 1907","13324":"It was published in the same year by the Matba\u2019 Mujtaba\u2019i in Lucknow, but remained out of print for over a century, until Noorani\u2019s current edition","13325":"Noorani has not only reprinted the original Arabic text, he has also translated it into Urdu, along with detailed annotations, comprehensive indexes and a learned preface, all to constitute an important critical edition of the work","13326":"As the scholar Arif Naushahi notes, Noorani\u2019s critical apparatus expands a 37-page tazkira into a work of nearly 500 pages","13327":"The book is divided into four parts: the first, by way of introduction, is a detailed study of Abd al Bari\u2019s life by Noorani","13328":"Part two is the Arabic text of the tazkira, followed by its Urdu translation","13329":"The last part consists of the editor\u2019s additional notes on each of the figures mentioned in the tazkira","13330":"A superb new book about a remarkable family of scholars fills in an important gap in our society\u2019s spiritual, intellectual, political and literary lineageThe tazkira proper consists of brief accounts of 137 Farangi Mahallis, to which the editor adds considerably in the form of annotations","13331":"These 137 include almost all of the major figures of Farangi Mahal, as well as many lesser known ones","13332":"Reading through these accounts, one gets a sense of how deeply the Farangi Mahallis are integrated into the wider South Asian world","13333":"As the reader works his way through these biographies, the book gradually seems to come alive with the bustle of life \u2014 Sufis, scholars, poets, teachers, lawyers, muftis, hakeems, officers and politicians, all rise from these lines to populate a world that is remarkable, not the least for emerging out of a single haveli","13334":"Interestingly, Abd al Bari includes a touching account of his mother as well, who passed away when he was still writing the book","13335":"For each Farangi Mahalli mentioned in the tazkira, Noorani has added considerable information from his own research, besides mentioning the precise sources for further research","13336":"These sources are themselves introduced and described in detail at the end of the work, making it a one-stop resource for those interested in diving deeper into the riches of Farangi Mahal","13337":"The introduction is a sympathetic study of the present tazkira\u2019s author Maulana Abd al Bari, one of the most important figures of early 20th century Islam and politics in South Asia, though hardly recognised as such","13338":"Noorani offers a vivid portrait of Abd al Bari\u2019s short (he died at 47) but prolific life","13339":"His biography is, in effect, a tour through the heady political ferment of the first two decades of the 20th century, when the all-Indian national struggle for greater independence from the British is running in parallel with the more particular projects and aspirations of Muslims and Hindus","13340":"At times, the courses of these parallel projects cross over, resulting in unlikely partnerships and alliances","13341":"One such historical chiasma is the Khilafat Movement, which saw the likes of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu alight at the doorstep of Abd al Bari\u2019s haveli in Lucknow, to organise an all-Indian resistance against the British","13342":"This was a high point of Muslim-Hindu political unity, with the Khilafat Movement and Gandhi\u2019s non-cooperation movement espousing and strengthening each other\u2019s causes in the face of a common enemy","13343":"The Khilafat Movement is, in fact, a theme that unites most of Abd al Bari\u2019s political activities","13344":"Abd al Bari\u2019s passionate attachment and protectiveness for Islam\u2019s sacred symbols in Makkah and Madina was, of course, not anomalous but representative of Indo-Islamic sentiments, informed as they were by deeply entrenched traditions of love for the Prophet (PBUH)","13345":"Thus, even though the disintegration of the Ottoman caliphate was a cause of great concern for the entire Islamic world, it was India, more than any other region, that saw the greatest agitation and political mobilisation to save the symbols of the Islamic past, as well as ensure the protection of the sacred sites in Makkah and Madina (a farsighted concern indeed, given what happened later to these under the British-supported Saudi regime)","13346":"Even before the Khilafat Movement, Maulana Abd al Bari was at the forefront of creating the Anjuman-i-Khuddam-i-Kaaba for a similar cause, and later, the All-India Khilafat Committee","13347":"The scenes hark back to a time when Islam in South Asia was deeply connected with happenings in other parts of the Muslim world \u2014 a stark contrast to our blatant hypocrisy today in maintaining careful silence over the plight of China\u2019s Uighur Muslims","13348":"Noorani narrates the socio-political developments contemporaneous with Abd al Bari\u2019s life vividly and with considerable archival depth, making a persuasive case for Maulana Abd al Bari as one of the most important Indian Muslim political leaders of the early 20th century","13349":"Despite this, popular discussions of the period, and of the Khilafat Movement, can often go on without as much as mentioning Abd al Bari","13350":"Noorani\u2019s may be the most complete account available so far of Abd al Bari\u2019s life and, hopefully will go some way towards addressing this lacuna","13351":"Politics, however, is only one aspect of Abd al Bari\u2019s multi-faceted personality \u2014 one which occupied him only in the last decade of his rather short life","13352":"Noorani offers a detailed view of Abd al Bari as a Sufi shaikh in the Qadiri order, a scholar, a mufti, as well as a tireless teacher","13353":"Despite the loss of several of his works, no less than 111 are still extant, including works on Arabic grammar, Islamic jurisprudence, theology, Sufism, hadith and Quranic exegesis","13354":"He was also a student of Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi\u2019s Masnavi, and taught it to his students","13355":"Unique among his writings is a Risala Science Aur Kalam, consisting of no less than 34 volumes, of which only one has been published so far","13356":"Finally, there are eight unpublished volumes of his correspondences and diaries, relating mainly to his political life, including letters to and from almost all the major political leaders of the time","13357":"Ulema-i-Farangi Mahal is thus an important step in bringing Farangi Mahal and Abd al Bari closer to us today, and complements well the scholar Francis Robinson\u2019s recent biography of Jamal Mian, who is Abd al Bari\u2019s son (Jamal Mian: The Life of Maulana Jamaluddin Abdul Wahhab of Farangi Mahall, 1919-2012)","13358":"As the reader of Noorani\u2019s work will be reminded, the community of ulema and sufiya have traditionally constituted a crucial part of our society\u2019s spiritual, intellectual, political and literary lives \u2014 something which has become very hard for most of us today even to imagine, given our presentist biases or outright ignorance of our pasts, both of which obstruct any proper view of this world","13359":"Finally, however strained the political relations between Pakistan and India may be, it is heartening to note that Noorani\u2019s book was published at the same time in both countries, and is thus read together by communities still united by ties that run deeper than the more recent political fissures that divide them","13360":"The

Renewable Energy (ARE) Policy 2020 that offers generous tax facilities to investors and promises induction of power plants on open competitive bidding for lowest tariff and technology transfer","13519":"Speaking at a news conference with Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry, Minister for Energy Omar Ayub Khan said the policy, approved in a recent meeting of the Council of Common Interests, targets increasing the share of ARE in total power supply to 20 per cent by 2025 and 30pc by 2030 from about 5pc at present","13520":"He said hydropower would soon be included in the ARE category under which its share would increase to 60pc of power generation by 2030","13521":"Coupled with Thar coal and nuclear power, the total share of power generation from indigenous sources would reach 75pc, he said","13522":"Mr Khan hoped the induction of power plants on open competitive bidding would bring down solar and wind tariff to less than four cents per unit and ultimately benefit the industry and domestic investments in localisation of solar panels, wind turbines and related equipment and material","13523":"Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Petroleum Nadeem Babar said the new ARE policy had five key features that were different from past policies","13524":"Firstly, the fundamental change from existing power policies was that investment would be solicited on competitive bid for lowest cost instead of upfront or cost-plus based tariff under all previous power policies, he said","13525":"Secondly, the federal government would decide on annual and three-year basis about the quantity of additional power requirement as before but it would be decided jointly by the four provinces, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan at a steering committee as to how much share be allocated to solar, wind, waste to energy or other technology and what should be their location","13526":"Third, the currency devaluation factor would be taken care of in bids for tariff","13527":"The indexation would be treated as cost of tariff because the one of the major reasons behind tariff increase in the past were unlimited dollar indexation, the SAPM explained","13528":"Fourthly, the policy gives incentives for technology transfer for local manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines and all related equipment for job creation for which Ministry of Science and Technology was finalising quality standards","13529":"Babar said three top Chinese companies and a leading European manufacturer had approached the government for setting up of manufacturing units for solar and wind equipment","13530":"Fifth, he said bidding would be based on two to three year forward looking energy requirements and on \u2018take and pay basis\u2019 without allowing capacity payment price to ensure that tariff is paid only for the electricity purchased and not for capacity availability","13531":"He said the import of equipment, machinery and manufacturing material would be exempted from custom duty or import duties and investments would be exempt from income tax and only withholding tax on dividends would be applicable","13532":"Wind and solar tariff had already come down to 4-4","13533":"5cents per unit and hoped it would go below 3","13534":"5cents per unit after bidding, he added","13535":"On the occasion, Chaudhry said Chinese companies were interested in relocation of their factories to Pakistan because of US-China trade war and the country was set to take a major benefit in the shape of manufacturing growth","13536":"He alleged that there was an import mafia which was making local production expensive and imported cheaper by charging zero-tax on furnished imported good and heavy tax on raw material","13537":"He further alleged that import of solar panels had earlier been used for money laundering and hence the Chinese government had been persuaded to provide import product certification","13538":"Under the new ARE policy, duties\/tax structure has been revised and now there is zero-tax on the equipments for renewable energy","13539":"This will help to attract the Chinese companies\u2019 relocation to Pakistan","13540":"Chaudhry said that when Covid-19 started Pakistan was importing every Covid related supplies from abroad","13541":"Now within few months Pakistan has become a major exporter of the Covid-19 supplies, he added","13542":"He said that within one year Pakistan will establish its own industry for the production of renewable energy equipments locally","13543":"Babar said the strategic objective of the policy was energy security, affordability of electricity, availability for all and environmental protection for sustainable development","13544":"The policy seeks to expanded scope to

Sultan on Tuesday claimed that there was no fault in the fertiliser subsidy scheme, but held the Punjab government of his own Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) responsible for its failure","13631":"Mr Sultan said the Punjab government did not deposit the required amount in the bank account due to which farmers could not get benefit of the subsidy worth billions of rupees","13632":"In response to a calling attention notice moved by five PTI members from Punjab \u201cregarding not reaching of subsidy on fertiliser and seed to the farmers\u201d, the parliamentary secretary informed the National Assembly that there was \u201cno technical fault in the token scheme","13633":"It failed because the Punjab government had not deposited the required amount in the account, which caused the error\u201d","13634":"He was responding to the criticism by his party colleagues who complained that farmers could not get any benefit of the huge subsidy that the government had announced for them by asking them to get the subsidised amount from banks by showing the tokens or scratch cards they got with the purchased bags of DAP fertiliser","13635":"The secretary said the federal government had allocated Rs37 billion for the subsidy on fertilisers for the farmers and it would itself monitor and keep a check on its distribution despite the fact that the agriculture was a devolved subject under the 18th Amendment","13636":"Under the new scheme, he said, the farmers would get Rs925 subsidy per DAP fertiliser bag","13637":"However, he said the federal government would submit the whole amount in the bank accounts and expressed the hope that the farmers would not face any difficulty in future","13638":"Mr Sultan also disclosed that the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had rejected the proposed schemes that had been submitted by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan as all the three provinces had proposed their own separate procedure for the distribution of the subsidy","13639":"He said the ECC wanted to have a uniform system for the distribution of the subsidy amount","13640":"He made it clear that the Sindh government had not submitted any proposal in this regard","13641":"The parliamentary secretary also disclosed that the provinces had informed the government that they would not be able to offer the subsidy on fertilisers for the upcoming Kharif crops and it would only be available for Rabi crops","13642":"Mr Sultan told the assembly that the government approached the fertiliser companies and the importers asking them to reduce the price at the time of purchase, but they had refused to do so, saying they had no trust in the provincial governments which had not yet paid Rs480 million outstanding against them for the past four to five years","13643":"Earlier, moving the notice, Sardar Talib Nakai regretted that the subsidy announced by the government in the past had been wasted, as the farmers did not benefit","13644":"Only some farmers, he said, were lucky enough to get Rs300 to Rs800 through tokens they got with the bags as lotteries","13645":"Meanwhile, speaking on a point of order, parliamentary leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Khawaja Asif condemned the alleged brutal police action against the opposition party workers in Lahore at the time of the appearance of PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz before the National Accountability Bureau (NAB)","13646":"Mr Asif questioned the deployment of heavy contingents of policemen outside National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore office, saying that such a large number of policemen were not deployed even outside the Supreme Court or other courts","13647":"The PML-N leader criticised the Punjab government for mishandling the situation and said if such actions were not stopped, then the PTI government would be fully responsible for spoiling country\u2019s political atmosphere","13648":"Responding to his speech, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said there was a need to hold an inquiry into the incident to know as to why it had happened","13649":"The minister said that the police and the government knew that such a situation could not be in their benefit and they also tried to avoid it","13650":"However, he said, anyone could do a \u201cfoolish act\u201d and there was a need to take steps and devise a mechanism to avoid such incidents in future","13651":"Published in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","13652":"Sometimes historiography of a nation or a society is written in a way that\u2019s not comprehensive and creates no historical consciousness","13653":"It misguides the reader in clearly understanding the historical consequences of an event","13654":"Pakistani historiography is neither anti-Indian nor pro-British rule","13655":"Our historians seem to have overlooked the exploitative aspect of colonialism and the negative impact it has had on our society","13656":"Because of this historical ignorance, it is widely believed that British rule was a blessing for us, it civilised us and opened the gates for our progress","13657":"On the other hand, Indian historians critically examined the colonial rule concluding that the Indian society suffered as a result of colonial rule and lost its initiative to develop and modernise itself","13658":"They pointed out that while the Industrial Revolution was happening in England, India was being de-industrialised by the British government","13659":"While the British undermined feudalism in their own country, they empowered it in India for their vested interest, using the feudal lords as their collaborators","13660":"Historians argue that industrialisation in India would have produced its own bourgeoisie which would lead eventually to modernisation","13661":"In fact, the British intervention prevented this process","13662":"Moreover, the government of the East India Company composed, edited and implemented the Muslim and Hindu religious laws consequently impeding the process of secularisation of the legal system, thus strengthening religious fundamentalism","13663":"As far as the question of civilising Indians is concerned, the British only modernised and Europeanised the upper classes leaving multitudes of Indians illiterate and uncivilised","13664":"This point is exhaustively dealt by G","13665":"Aloysius in his book Nationalism without a nation in India","13666":"When the British introduced the modern European educational system, it fulfilled their design to recruit a class of Indians who could perform subordinate jobs for them","13667":"The British also used education as an effective tool to change the mindset of people and make the young and educated generation pro-British","13668":"Gauri Viswanathan in her book Mask of Conquest: Literary Study and British Rule in India points out that by introducing English literature, an attempt was made to change the world view of western-educated people","13669":"Interestingly, Shakespeare was not included in the curriculum","13670":"Modern education created a new class in India deeply influenced by Western civilisation, which soon became alienated from its own culture","13671":"Hence the British used military powers and education to create a special class among Indians who remained loyal to the British rule","13672":"Those who admire British rule for introducing new technology and changing the Indian lifestyle fail to realise that innovation and inventions in any country or part of the world will eventually spread to other countries","13673":"We have historical evidence that Chinese inventions have been adapted in other nations","13674":"Technology cannot be limited or confined to one country for a very long period","13675":"Therefore, India would have become modernised independently and the British may have only accelerated the process","13676":"There are examples of many countries which did not experience colonialism, yet became modernised changing their social, political, and economic structure","13677":"Historians like Dadabhai Naoroji and Rajni Pandat have systematically examined the exploitation of the British Raj, highlighting the plunder of Indian resources by the British","13678":"Hamza Alavi also points out that during the Industrial Revolution in England, the contribution of East India Company and its profit from Indian trade played a significant role","13679":"However, the question remains why people regard the British rule a blessing for India","13680":"One of the reasons may be that as in the case of Pakistan, when people face injustice, violation of law, political instability and economic crisis, they look back to the peaceful and pleasant past","13681":"On the other hand, countries enjoying political stability and economic prosperity have long forgotten British rule \u2014 Malaysia being an example","13682":"Those who believe that Pakistanis have no intellectual capacity or creative power, argue that only with the help of foreign power can we change our society","13683":"This dependency on foreign power has deprived us of the energy and initiative to develop our country with our own resources","13684":"There is a pertinent need to re-examine the colonial period and rewrite history with a fresh perspective","13685":"England may have won the series opener against Pakistan but the absence of Ben Stokes leaves them with arguably the bigger selection headache going into Thursday's second Test at Southampton","13686":"Pakistan were much the better side for much of last week's first Test at Old Trafford and, despite a second-innings collapse, were still favourites to win when they reduced England to 117-5 in pursuit of a target of 277","13687":"But a sixth-wicket partnership of 139 between Chris Woakes (84 not out) and Jos Buttler (75) turned the tide as England went 1-0 up in the three-match series on Saturday","13688":"Since England won with more than a day to spare in Manchester, it has been announced that star all-rounder Stokes will miss the rest of the series as a result of travelling to New Zealand to be with his ill father","13689":"A quad injury meant that the end of England's 2-1 series win over the West Indies last month \u2014 a campaign that marked international cricket's return from the coronavirus lockdown \u2014 and the first Test against Pakistan saw vice-captain Stokes effectively deployed as a specialist batsman by skipper Joe Root","13690":"Stokes, however, still took two important wickets on the third evening against Pakistan","13691":"The obvious move for England would be to recall batsman Zak Crawley, who has missed out on the last two matches while an extra bowler has been deployed because of Stokes' injury problems","13692":"Buttler underlined his skill in a run-chase last week but the wicketkeeper, by his own admission, had a poor match with the gloves","13693":"England do have the option to recall Ben Foakes, widely regarded as a better keeper, and play Buttler as a specialist batsman","13694":"But Root appeared wary of that suggestion when he praised fellow World Cup winner Buttler's innings by saying: \u201cI think it will provide him with a huge amount of confidence in all aspects of his game and he should take that forward for the rest of the series","13695":"\u201d Root himself could do with a big score having managed just one Test hundred in 18 months","13696":"England are in the middle of a sequence of six Tests in seven weeks, a gruelling schedule that has seen them adopt a policy of rotating their quicks","13697":"James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker bristled at talk he was considering retirement after a meagre match haul of 1-97 at his Lancashire home ground last week meant the 38-year-old has taken just six wickets at an expensive average of 41 in three Tests this season","13698":"He could now make way for left-armer Sam Curran, who has won all his eight home Tests, or fast bowler Mark Wood","13699":"Pakistan coach Misbah-ul-Haq insisted his side could recover from an agonising loss as they try to avoid a defeat that will condemn them to a first series defeat by England in a decade","13700":"\u201cWe need to improve 10 to 15 per cent and deal with pressure situations a little better but we shouldn't be mentally down,\u201d he said, with Pakistan denied the usual vocal support they enjoy in England after Covid-19 turned this campaign into a behind-closed-doors series","13701":"Pakistan captain Azhar Ali, criticised for his tactics during Buttler and Woakes' decisive stand, has made just one fifty in 10 innings since becoming skipper in November","13702":"But he denied captaincy was affecting his batting","13703":"\u201cWhen I bat, I'm not thinking about the captaincy, whether or not I'm out of form","13704":"\u201cAnd when I'm captain, I don't think about my batting at all","13705":"\u201d Should Pakistan have concerns about the fitness of their pace trio of Mohammad Abbas, Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, they could bring in another quick such as Sohail Khan","13706":"Pakistan played two leg-spinners at Old Trafford, with Shadab Khan backing up Yasir Shah, but they could now deploy a fourth seamer if they feel the Ageas Bowl pitch won't take as much turn","13707":"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday increased limit for housing finance loans to Rs3 million from Rs1m for borrowings from the microfinance banks","13708":"The SBP in a press release said the maximum size of general loans has also been enhanced from Rs150,000 to Rs350,000","13709":"It said that in order to commensurate with enhanced loan sizes, annual income eligibility for general loans and housing loans has been increased up to Rs1","13710":"2m and Rs1","13711":"5m respectively","13712":"The limit for lending against gold collateral to meet borrowers\u2019 immediate domestic or emergency needs has also been enhanced","13713":"Microfinance banks can now extend loans against gold collateral for consumption purposes categorised as domestic needs or emergency loan, said the SBP adding that the  aggregate loan exposure of a bank against the security of gold will not exceed 50 per cent of its gross loan portfolio","13714":"\u201cThe above relaxations will expire after one year from the date of issuance of these instructions","13715":"Thereafter, MFBs will reduce their aggregate loan exposure against the security of gold to 35pc within a maximum period of one year,\u201d said the SBP","13716":"Emphasising the need to increase housing loans, the SBP said the decision to increase the limit of housing finance loans has been made in view of the fact that the existing loan limit was insufficient to promote low-cost housing finance through MFBs","13717":"Similarly, limits for lending to micro enterprises needed to be enhanced considering the large unmet demand from micro and small enterprises","13718":"\u201cThese initiatives would further support micro borrowers and enterprises and an early revival of economic activities in the current challenging times,\u201d said the SBP","13719":"However, in order to ensure sustainability, the enhanced loans sizes for housing and microenterprises would be allowed to those MFBs which are on sound footing and have the capacity to successfully cater the higher loan sizes","13720":"\u201cOnly those MFBs that are fully compliant with Minimum Capital Require\u00adment (MCR) and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) shall be eligible to undertake microenterprise lending,\u201d said the SBP","13721":"In addition, the SBP\u2019s relief package for microfinance banks, which included deferment of principal and restructuring of

for 43 consecutive days","13732":"Health authorities have again shown concern in new infections linked to churches","13733":"\u201cThe new cluster infections came as the patients did not wear

luck in that partnership","13771":"A lot of balls went here and there, into no man\u2019s land","13772":"If one of those goes to a fielder then the situation could have been very different","13773":"We still need to improve, of course, but overall we fought really well against a top team in our first international fixture for six months","13774":"It was a brave decision to bat

and administrative mismanagement, requiring use of military force","13909":"Contrary to the predominant ethos of respect for diversity practised by most Muslims, bursts of extremism by small numbers of fanatics were unwisely permitted in the decades to come until they ballooned into showy piety, religiosity and violent sectarianism","13910":"The aberrations of those years were partly the fallout from what was happening on the other track \u2014 on which individual ambition, lust for power, party divisions, increasing involvement of the military \u2014 all were combusting into ultimate implosions, first in 1958 and then, catastrophically in 1971","13911":"The most interesting facet of the first 18 years was that, with fluent ease, speed and grace, people of enormous diversity who had never before lived together as a single nation-state, interacted emotively and began to share hopes for a common future","13912":"This broad, deep sense of fraternity transcended the bitterness and alienation caused in East Pakistan because of the delay in recognising Bengali as a state language and the persistent conviction that the west wing only exploited the east wing","13913":"So strong was this affinity that the overwhelming majority of Bengali East Pakistanis wanted to remain citizens of Pakistan, be it a federation or a confederation, right up to March 1, 1971, when the first shock was imparted through the postponement of the National Assembly session set for March 3, 1971","13914":"Also read: The Breakup of Pakistan 1969-1971And even though the military operation launched

investigative works about the social and cultural dimensions of Pakistan in its first two decades","13919":"The paucity is particularly notable in educational textbooks and in public discourse","13920":"Without ignoring the other track \u2014 the harsh economic, political realities of those years \u2014 it is vitally relevant to re-visit the 1947-1965 phase","13921":"Not for

around common issues often helps nudge governments towards addressing these challenges in the absence of constraints","13929":"How\u00ad\u00adever, one common mistake in this discou\u00adrse is to make a direct comparison between developing and developed countries","13930":"Comparing the governance outcomes of Pakistan with Britain today while attributing the \u2018performance gap\u2019 entirely to Pakistan\u2019s inability to develop is misleading","13931":"This is because such a view of economic development assumes away the role of history and the long-run dynamics of economic development","13932":"Take colonialism as a starting point","13933":"Most of the developing world had to bear the brunt of excessively extractive colonial institutions in recent history","13934":"Britain\u2019s conscious deindustrialisation of the textile sector in the Indian subcontinent and Spain\u2019s violent enslavement of the indigenous population in Latin America to extract precious metals are just a few examples of how colonialism impoverished the developing world","13935":"At the same time, this violent, and often genocidal form of wealth extraction provided colonial masters with the capital and labour for their \u2018economic development\u2019","13936":"The traditional narrative of Britain\u2019s development being solely attributable to the mechanisation that took place during the industrial revolution, without any role of colonial wealth extraction, rests on shaky grounds","13937":"Similarly, poverty in the developing world has a lot to do with colonialism \u2014 a fact that is often uncomfortable for developed countries to admit","13938":"History\u2019s role is often overlooked in assessing development","13939":"Upon independence from their colonial masters, the developing world still had the remnants of extractive public institutions","13940":"Britain certainly did not introduce taxation and policing in its colonies as a benevolent dictator with the objective to improve people\u2019s well-being","13941":"Instead, these institutions were designed for more nefarious purposes such as to exert control over colonies, maximise wealth extraction and ensure unfair market access for Britain\u2019s goods","13942":"With path-dependency playing an important role, such institutions became hard to change after independence","13943":"These post-colonial public institutions exacerbated economic outcomes in the developing world","13944":"It is also important to understand the long-run dynamics of economic development","13945":"Apart from a few exceptions, development is a gradual process that is hard to witness on a daily basis, but relatively easier to see in the long run","13946":"It might surprise you that Pakistan\u2019s GDP per capita, after adjusting for purchasing power parity, almost doubled in the last 20 years","13947":"While we might not see Pakistan developing on a day-to-day basis, the long-run trend shows a different picture","13948":"Hence, it is important to remember that countries become developed by growing consistently and sustainably at moderate rates of growth over a long duration of time","13949":"This is not to say that we do not have exceptions \u2014 China and South Korea grew consistently at a high rate of growth over the last few decades","13950":"But the general rule of moderate and sustainable levels of growth as a path to economic development is important to keep in mind","13951":"Developing countries might aspire to emulate China and South Korea, but not being able to do so is certainly not a failure","13952":"A flat out, cross-sectional comparison of developing and developed countries that ends up blaming developing countries entirely for a lack of an ability to \u2018catch up\u2019 pays little heed to the historical role of colonialism and extraction","13953":"It also ignores the fact that economic development is a long process that is hard to observe on a daily basis and requires consistency and patience","13954":"This is not to say that developing countries should blame every problem on history or be complacent","13955":"Pakistan has been independent for over 70 years and we have to take responsibility for our own actions","13956":"A lot of the governance issues that we see around us could be solved by our citizens and policymakers","13957":"While some development outcomes might have improved, we have certainly contributed towards worsening existing problems or creating new ones","13958":"The public discourse around economic de\u00ad\u00adve\u00adlopment often commits the error of making a cross-sectional comparison between developing and developed nations","13959":"Such an attitude towards our current problems can be counterproductive because it paves the way for excessive self-blame and feelings of inferiority","13960":"If we as citizens attribute the entire performance gap of Pakistan with any developed country to our inability to reform, we run the risk of overestimating our flaws and underestimating the role of historical path-dependence","13961":"A more nuanced understanding of economic development could help us move away from such thinking so that we focus more on how we can solve our problems in the future","13962":"The writer is a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford and a

and polio,\u201d she said","14047":"Published in Dawn, August 12th, 2020","14048":"BEDMINSTER: President Donald Trump on Saturday signed executive actions extending financial relief to Americans hit by the coronavirus pandemic as polls showed a large majority of voters unhappy with his handling of the crisis","14049":"The four measures marked a presidential show of strength after Trump\u2019s Republican party and White House team failed to agree with opposition Democrats in Congress on a new stimulus package aimed at stopping vulnerable Americans from falling through the cracks","14050":"\u201cWe\u2019ve had it and we\u2019re going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers,\u201d Trump said at a press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was spending the weekend","14051":"With double digit unemployment, disruption to businesses from social distancing rules, and persistent coronavirus spread, many Americans had been relying on relief measures approved earlier by Congress, but which mostly expired in July","14052":"Trump said his decision to circumvent Congress with executive actions would mean relief money getting \u201crapidly distributed\u201d","14053":"In reality, his measures are likely to face court challenges because Congress controls federal spending, and in any case they may add up to less money than initially appears","14054":"For Trump, lagging badly in the polls against his Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the November 3 presidential election, the orders were partly about showing he is in charge","14055":"He turned the signing ceremony in the ballroom of the golf club into an assault on his opponents and threw in several false claims about his accomplishments in office","14056":"To cheers from club members invited to watch the event, Trump insulted the Democratic \u201ccrazy\u201d leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, denounced Biden as \u201cfar left,\u201d and claimed that Democrats want to \u201csteal the election","14057":"\u201d Biden called Trump\u2019s orders \u201ca series of half-baked measures","14058":"\u201d \u201cThey are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility,\u201d Biden said, adding that Americans need a \u201creal leader\u201d who would work to hammer out a deal with lawmakers","14059":"One key Trump order promises to get $400 a week added to Americans\u2019 unemployment benefits, while two others offer some protection from evictions and relief for student loans","14060":"The $400 assistance is below the $600 offered in the expired stimulus package","14061":"It may also end up amounting only to $300 extra a week, because Trump said $100 would be provided from state, not federal, budgets \u2014 and only if states were willing or able to do so","14062":"A fourth measure \u2014 opposed by many Republicans as well as Democrats \u2014 ordered a freeze in payroll taxes","14063":"This makes a big headline for Trump but is only a deferral, rather than a cut in the tax","14064":"\u201cToday\u2019s meager announcements show President Trump still does not comprehend the seriousness or the urgency of the health and economic crises facing working families,\u201d Pelosi said on Twitter","14065":"\u201cThese policies provide little real help for families","14066":"\u201d Democrats, Republicans and White House negotiators had worked all last week without coming close to a deal on an overall congressional relief bill for those struggling to make ends meet in the world\u2019s richest economy","14067":"Democrats pushed for a massive new $3 trillion stimulus package aimed at propping up the economy, repairing the tattered postal system in time for the presidential election and giving the unemployed an extra $600 a week","14068":"Democrats later announced they could drop the price tag but refused the Republicans\u2019 offer of a $1 trillion package","14069":"Published in Dawn, August 10th, 2020","14070":"ON Wednesday, the National Assembly passed five more FATF-related bills as a result of an understanding between the government and the opposition","14071":"There was some acrimony on the floor of the house when Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the opposition had wanted to link its support for the bills earlier with NAB law amendments, but Speaker Asad Qaisar managed to deftly control the situation","14072":"He had also played a key behind-the-scenes role in bringing the two sides to agree on the bills before they were brought to the floor","14073":"This is a good development and it strengthens Pakistan\u2019s position when its case for removal from the grey list comes up at the next meeting of the Financial Action Task Force","14074":"The pressing urgency to get this legislation done is dictated by FATF requirements but it is in the interest of Pakistan to make such laws that curtail terror financing and money laundering","14075":"In fact, ideally Pakistan should not have waited for FATF pressure to get such legislation done, and instead, enacted these laws on its own","14076":"The country has suffered tremendously due to terrorism and it is in our interest to take all steps necessary to ensure terror outfits do not take root in the country again","14077":"It goes to our credit that we have been able to degrade and defeat the scourge of terrorism but we must continue to reform our systems and plug weaknesses wherever identified so that the infrastructure of terrorism is dismantled fully","14078":"However, as things stand now, it is hoped that the FATF will appreciate the steps that Pakistan has taken in light of the requirements laid down by it","14079":"The passage of bills by consensus at a time of acute polarisation is a good sign","14080":"While it may suggest that the government and the opposition may have been nudged and pushed into forging a consensus on these bills, it is heartening that both sides have managed to overcome their mutual distrust and partisanship to push the legislation through","14081":"Hopefully, this would help build a better working relationship in parliament","14082":"One point of concern is the attempt by the government to add some draconian measures to these bills that were not a requirement of the FATF","14083":"The opposition had pointed these out and requisite amendments were made","14084":"All concerned should ensure such measures that curtail the rights of citizens should not sneak their way into future legislation","14085":"Published in Dawn, August 14th, 2020","14086":" An old clip of actress Mawra Hocane from a television morning show, in which she appears to be accepting of the male culture of teasing and catcalling, has whipped up quite a debate on mainstream and social media","14087":"Some believe that, while it might be fine for stars to get the fun part of teasing, it\u2019s not at all okay for many girls and women to feel harassed in public places","14088":"This is a fair point","14089":"It wouldn\u2019t hurt our actors and actresses to weigh their words during casual chats before

recent interview, the Bollywood starlet has talked about the kind of sexism that exists in the Indian film industry","14093":"She told the interviewer that, at meetings where directors and writers narrate stories to actors, they make more eye contact with the male lead but not with the female actor","14094":"She termed it a subliminal condition","14095":"We agree with you","14096":"But could it also mean that male directors and writers are intimidated by female actors","14097":"We thought that Shah Rukh Khan, who has been missing from the world of cinema ever since Zero tanked at the box office, would stage a comeback with Rajkumar Hirani\u2019s next film","14098":"Nope, that\u2019s not happening, because the film hasn\u2019t yet received permission from the Canadian authorities for shooting (it\u2019s supposed to be filmed in North America), and is hence delayed","14099":"Now SRK will flex his acting muscles (whatever is left of them) in October in a movie directed by Siddharth Arnand (Bang Bang, War)","14100":"Not much is known about the project, except that it\u2019s an action-packed drama and might have Deepika Padukone opposite him","14101":"Alrighty then \u2014 Rajkumar H has never failed as a director, SRK\u2019s chemistry with Deepika P has always worked on celluloid, and Siddharth A is one of the most successful and sought-after young filmmakers","14102":"All

declaring my gas meter as PUG\/slow","14122":"My customer number is 0436089975","14123":"The actual gas volume as being recorded each month is one cubic metre only, as my ground floor portion was vacated by my former tenant in November 2019 and is still unoccupied","14124":"SSGC had been charging around Rs230 for the last six months","14125":"Then suddenly they charged me an extra Rs463 in my current bill on account of PUG\/slow meter","14126":"May I ask SSGC higher-ups how did they come to the conclusion that my meter is PUG\/slow","14127":"There are multiple reasons for a meter being PUG\/slow","14128":"SSGC is well aware of the fact that, according to the Oil and Gas Regulating Authority (Ogra), they cannot claim PUG\/slow meter charges from a customer unless the meter is removed and taken to their meter testing laboratory and tested in presence of the customer concerned","14129":"If the meter is found slow by more than two per cent then alone can SSGC claim PUG\/slow meter charges","14130":"In my case, by charging an extra Rs463 without testing the meter, SSGC has violated Ogra regulations","14131":"SSGC is in the habit of claiming PUG\/slow meter charges from millions of their customers whenever they notice a drop in volume and thus ignore Ogra\u2019s regulations","14132":"I would urge SSGC to send their billing inspector to check my meter in my presence","14133":"I will provide a copy of the K-Electric bill showing zero consumption for my unoccupied ground floor","14134":"After verification that my meter is okay, SSGC should withdraw the

of the virus","14176":"The famous Trans-Indus Railway line was constructed by the British in 1913 to provide safe and quicker transport to their military personnel beyond the natural boundary of River Indus and deep inside the unpredictable terrain of the formidable Pakhtuns","14177":"Initially owned by the North Western Railway (NWR) of Britain, it was locally known as the Mari Indus Railway and its initial run from Daud Khel in Mianwali district, Punjab till Lakki Marwat in Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was 92 kilometres","14178":"It was the first-ever narrow-gauge track \u2014 two feet and six inches \u2014 in the region","14179":"This \u201cchhoti rail\u201d [small rail] as it was called, started from the outskirts of a big military depot near Mari Indus Station and halted at Lakki Marwat Junction and was soon extended up to the important garrison towns of Bannu and Tank","14180":"This engineering spectacle was, however, unceremoniously done away with by Pakistan Railways in 1995","14181":"Many whistle-blowing steam locomotives had negotiated its curved lines for 82 years","14182":"These aesthetically beautiful engines were either manufactured at Glasgow or in Germany and were meticulously maintained by the railway engineers for almost a century","14183":"Many youngsters today don\u2019t know as to why the British laid such extensive railway lines in far-flung areas of the Subcontinent and, that too, at a time when even common bitumen roads were nonexistent in this area","14184":"The colonial masters of undivided India not only had grand ambitions to expand their empire deep into the Afghan territories, but also wanted to stem a constant threat from the north-western tribesmen","14185":"So, they used their technological superiority in putting together ambitious railway projects to connect their frontier strongholds via rail to safer military hubs in the mainland","14186":"It\u2019s astonishing that all of this happened more than a 100 years ago, whereas the current road connectivity in the entire expanse of Lakki Marwat is in absolute tatters","14187":"The strategic importance of this landscape has, in fact, increased over the years but, sadly, the southern region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is now worse off in terms of routes connectivity than what it was almost a century ago under British rule","14188":"A century ago, the now forgotten Lakki Marwat train station was a strategic stop in the vast network of railway lines laid by the British","14189":"It\u2019s a historical asset that needs to be saved from negligence and plunderersI was lucky to have undertaken a return journey on this railway track in 1982","14190":"I was very young then, but can easily evoke the memory of that rail plying on those lonely tracks in a vast sandy expanse, with the ambling gait of a mare","14191":"The chhoti rail started from Mari Indus in Punjab and crossed the mighty Indus via the historical dual-purpose iron bridge of Kalabagh","14192":"After passing through Kamar Mashani, Trag and Isa Khel, it reached the dual-purpose Gambila River Bridge at Darra Tang","14193":"From here onwards, the sandy plains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the fun part of the journey started","14194":"Many enterprising youngsters disembarked and started to run along the train until their own steam ran out","14195":"Since there were no lavatories in any of the four train compartments, some daring passengers also answered nature\u2019s call on the sides of the track and managed to hop on board again","14196":"The speed of the chhoti rail was purposely kept slow as was the common routine","14197":"The train transited through Thanedar Wala, Wanda Arsala and eventually reached Lakki Marwat Junction","14198":"In later years, whenever I visited my village, I always satiated my nostalgic cravings by visiting Lakki Station","14199":"To this day, despite all sorts of neglect, the fort-shaped, symmetrical building of the station still stands tall","14200":"Back then, it was at a little distance from the municipality, but now it has been completely surrounded by the growing town","14201":"Being a small and conservative town, Lakki Marwat had no proper eateries until the late 1990s","14202":"Therefore, for a long period, even after the closure of the railway service, the station\u2019s canteen remained popular for its affordable, delicious food","14203":"Its famed custard was one of the few luxuries available to the locals, and a must-have for any visitor from out of town","14204":"I still remember munching on the cake chunks hidden inside that delectable custard","14205":"However, once this rail line was formally closed, the state conveniently forgot its stations","14206":"Since then, the sturdy colonial-era infrastructure and fa\u00e7ade of the Lakki Station has steadily decayed","14207":"But the turrets on both corners of the main station are still fully intact, and so is the signature British-era, brown water tank used for filling the engines, etc","14208":"This water tower has beautiful Gothic supports to mitigate the effects of occasional earthquakes","14209":"A glance at the various structures of this station is a reminder of how thorough and professional the British were as they considered every minor detail well in advance","14210":"On the contrary, looking at the obvious indifference of Pakistan Railways towards these vital assets, many ungrateful local thugs have started to steal its rusted tracks in broad daylight","14211":"When a few worried locals complained to the state to save this heritage from vandalism, Pakistan Railways responded in its own strange way and auctioned off these priceless railway tracks for peanuts before the start of the 21st century, to get rid of the issue once and for all","14212":"For someone who has seen this railway line operational, I had tears in my eyes when I saw the famous Gambila Bridge of Darra Tang in its current truncated shape","14213":"The dismantled and stolen iron from the tracks was presumably sold to the steel foundries of Punjab, as if the British had laid down this raw material as a gift for Pakistani factories a century ago","14214":"Even when the Gambila Bridge was operational and was used by trains and vehicles alike, its maintenance was always a bone of contention between the Highways Department and the Railway Department","14215":"Presently, most of the iron part of Gambila Bridge is still there, as the clueless contractors probably didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to dismantle it","14216":"Additionally, a few metres of derelict tracks may also exist here and there, covered by sand","14217":"However, the precious land of those removed tracks, which passed inside Lakki town, has already been conveniently gobbled by powerful locals for constructing private properties","14218":"If Pakistan Railways can commendably preserve its Golra Railway Station and convert it into a museum, then why did it fail to do so with this century-old railway line with its beautiful colonial structures","14219":"At a bare minimum, they could have sanctioned a fortnightly or a monthly safari train for adventurous people","14220":"Many would have loved to travel in small wooden compartments, pulled by a quixotic engine, and experience a scene akin to those in black and white classic Westerns","14221":"Currently, in addition to the disappearance of the entire length of tracks, both the stops at Thanedar Wala and Wanda Arsala have also been leveled to the ground, and the entire tract is now privately cultivated to grow seasonal crops","14222":"However, the main building of Lakki Marwat Junction is still standing against all odds","14223":"It is being used by the personnel of Lakki Police under an unknown arrangement, but most of the rooms in the main building seem to be intact","14224":"Efforts should be made to conserve structures such as the Lakki Marwat Station","14225":"Wherever possible, Pakistan Railways must convert them either into small museums, commercial rest houses or restaurants","14226":"Like any civilised society, we must look after our historical assets","14227":"Absence of swift damage control will lead to the razing of these surviving remnants of the once great Trans-Indus Railway and also open the way for other illegal usage of precious state land","14228":"The writer is a civil servantPublished in Dawn, EOS, July 31st, 2020"}}
